However, middle-aged and older dogs are more likely to contract this disorder. Diagnosis Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. Some of the common tests include a complete blood count and a urinalysis, which will usually return as normal. Imaging tools, such as X-rays and ultrasounds, are not applicable to this particular diagnosis. Some conditions that may produce symptoms similar to those caused by polyps include abscesses, tumors, inflammation, infection of the intestine, and rectal prolapse. Diagnosis, therefore, is usually made on the basis of a manual rectal examination by a veterinarian, or by direct visualization of the polyp through the external anal opening. After a polyp is identified, a colonoscopy, using a tubular, flexible camera inserted through the anal opening, may be performed to check for the presence of other polyps. A detailed pathological study of the tissue, as well as the fluid from the polyp, may also be completed. Treatment Surgery is usually indicated for the effective management of polyps. The polyps may be removed through the anal opening, after which the anal opening will be closed with stitches. The same removal surgery may be performed endoscopically, or by using an electrical needle or probe. Some medications that may be prescribed are: Non-steroidal pain relievers Antibiotics (especially before surgery to prevent infection) Stool softeners Possible complications include a relapse of the polyps and narrowing of the anal opening due to scarring and/or inflammation. Living and Management Your veterinarian will want to examine the surgical site after 14 days to make sure that the condition has been resolved and the tissue is healing properly. Another examination will be made at three months, and again at six months after surgery. Follow-up examinations will continue twice a year to check for recurrence. Dogs with single polyps usually do not relapse, those with multiple or diffuse lesions are at a much higher risk for recurrence.",

A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis -- the results of which may indicate the presence of substances that might be causing a slowed heart rate. These tests will also reveal deficiencies in the blood if that is the underlying cause. They also may offer clues to possible kidney failure. Your doctor can also use X-rays and ultrasound to visually examine your dog's internal organs for abnormalities in the heart, kidney and other organs. An electrocardiogram (EKG) recording can be used to examine the electrical currents in the heart muscles, and may reveal any abnormalities in cardiac electrical conduction, which underlies the heart’s ability to contract and beat. An initial 24-hour heart monitoring may be indicated to conclude a diagnosis. Treatment Treatment will be determined by any underlying disease that is found. Many dogs exhibit no clinical signs and require no treatment. In dogs without structural heart disease, heart rates as low as 40 to 50 bpm (beats per minute) are still generally able to provide normal cardiac output at rest. Therapeutic approaches vary markedly; they depend on what’s causing the SB, the ventricular rate, and the severity of clinical signs. If your dog is in critical condition, it may be treated as an inpatient, where intravenous fluid therapy can be administered and the dog's health stabilized. Restrictions on activity will not be recommended unless your dog has symptomatic SB that is related to structural heart disease; then exercise restriction will be recommended until medical and/or surgical intervention can stabilize the problem. Living and Management Your physician will order further monitoring depending on the final diagnosis. Signs, if present, should resolve with correction of the causative underlying condition. However, the overall long term prognosis varies with the nature of the structural heart disease, if there is one present. For example, treatment of symptomatic SB with a permanent pacemaker generally offers a good prognosis for rhythm control.",

Invagination, a folding in of the  enamel and/or cement of the tooth, sometimes occurs at the neck of the  tooth, often with some degree of gingival recession (receding of gums)  at the site. Diagnosis Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical and oral exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms, if there have been any. Dens-in-dente, an anomaly of development resulting from the deepening of enamel into the dental papilla (the cells involved in the developing tooth), typically begins at the crown and often extends to the root before the calcification of the dental tissues takes place. Traumatic damage to the tooth, possibly from aggressive deciduous tooth (i.e., baby tooth) extraction, may be linked to a loss of dental integrity. If your veterinarian finds that the tooth is too damaged to remain, an assessment of the remaining mandibular bone will be an important prior to an extraction attempt. The diagnostic evaluation will include taking a dental X-ray to evaluate the extent of the changes, particularly at the roots. Treatment Treatment for a dilacerated mandibular first molar will begin with the appropriate pre-operative antimicrobial and pain management therapy as it is indicated. In most cases, there will be indications of a non-vital pulp in the tooth, indicated by a wide canal, periapical (apex of the root), and bone loss. Extraction of the tooth is typically warranted. However, this should not be an aggressive procedure. Care should be taken, as osteolysis (the active resorption or dissolution of bone tissue) could result in a compromised mandible (lower jaw). Your veterinarian may consider the use of bone-promoting material after the extraction. Although rare, an endodontic procedure may be attempted to save the tooth in cases with minimal pathological changes. There is also a possibility stones in the tooth chamber could complicate canal access. Living and Management Your veterinarian will prescribe pain medication to help mitigate the amount of pain your dog is in, and to facilitate normal eating. After the initial care, your veterinarian will want to recheck your dog’s teeth at least once to be sure there is no infection and that the healing is on schedule. The prognosis is guarded for maintaining the tooth. However, an affected dog's long term health is fair to good if a tooth extraction is performed.",

Typically, there is a warm, non-painful lesion at the site of the fistula. If the lesion is on a limb, the dog may display: Swelling \twhere you can touch the limb and a fingertip impression is left in \tthe skin (pitting edema) Lameness Ulceration Scabbing Gangrene \t(Tissue dies and turns green) Signs of congestive heart failure, which is often associated with this type of fistula, include: Coughing Difficulty \tbreathing ( dyspnea ) Increased \theart rate \t( tachypnea ) Exercise \tintolerance If the arteriovenous fistula causes organ failure, your dog may display: Distention \tof the abdomen (liver) Seizures \t(brain) Weakness \tor paralysis (spinal cord) Causes Dogs are rarely born with arteriovenous fistulas. Typically, they acquire the fistula due to  traumatic damage to blood vessels, surgery complications, tumor(s), or problems arising from drawing blood or injections around the blood vessels (e.g., barbiturates) Diagnosis You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel to help identify complications associated with an arteriovenous fistula. Biochemical abnormalities, for example, may suggest liver, kidney or other organ dysfunction. Because arteriovenous fistulae significantly affect the dog's blood flow, thoracic X-rays may show enlargement of the heart and signs of over-circulation to the lungs. In addition, a Doppler ultrasound may show high-velocity, turbulent flow within the lesion. To locate the arteriovenous fistula, your veterinarian may employ an echocardiogram on the dog. And to outline the lesion, which may be necessary for definitive diagnosis and is highly desirable for presurgical evaluation, the veterinarian may use selective angiography. Treatment Dogs with clinical signs must undergo surgery to divide and remove abnormal connections between blood vessels.  However, surgery can be difficult and labor-intensive and may require blood transfusions. While often successful, the arteriovenous fistula may recur even after surgery. Some dogs may even require amputation of the affected appendage. A newer treatment option called transcatheter embolization involves using a catheter to block blood vessels. This method is particularly advantageous because it is relatively noninvasive and provides access to remote lesions via the blood vessels. Living and Management Your veterinarian will want to schedule regular follow-up appointments to evaluate your dog, especially if it underwent surgery. This will also enable him or her to determine whether the arteriovenous fistula has recurred.",

However, there is also an acquired form of the condition, which results from diseases that put undue pressure on the bladder (e.g., bacterial urinary tract infections, uroliths, and urethral plugs). There is no breed or age predisposition for vesicouracahal deiverticula. Diagnosis You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms. The veterinarian will then conduct a complete physical examination, as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, and complete blood count (CBC) -- the results of which help identify the underlying cause of the condition and the present of concurrent disorders. The best tool for confirming diagnosis, however, is X-rays of the urethra and bladder while using contrast medium. Treatment The course of treatment will ultimately depend on the underlying cause of vesicourachal diverticula. Dogs that do not respond to conventional treatment may require surgery to correct the defect. Living and Management You will need to visit the veterinarian for regular follow-up exams, where he or she will take urine samples to evaluate the status of infection. Some animals will require long-term antibiotic therapy to combat urinary tract infections. However, overall prognosis in dogs with vesicourachal diverticula is good after treatment.",

The center is filled with either thick liquid or solid material consisting of white blood cells, dead tissue, and sometimes bacteria. There are four common locations for abscesses in dogs. Teeth : In a dental abscess, there is infection involving the root of a tooth. The bony socket surrounding the affected root is usually eaten away by the infection, and the surrounding gum is inflamed. Skin : Trauma from a bite, a splinter, or something sharp your dog has stepped on can insert bacteria and other foreign debris under the skin.

A dog with a dental abscess may not be eating normally and may prefer soft food over hard food or treats. Avid chewers may stop chewing toys and bones they once enjoyed. There may also be facial swelling in the region of the affected tooth. Skin abscesses are painful, warm, soft, or firm lumps. If the abscess is on a paw or leg, you may notice your dog limping. Your dog may cry out or wince if you touch the abscess site. Anal sac abscess pain may result in a dog licking excessively under the tail, scooting on the floor, or straining to have a bowel movement. If the anal sac has ruptured through the skin, you may notice drainage from the site. Causes of Abscesses in Dogs Dental abscesses Dental disease—tartar accumulation and gingival inflammation Fractured (broken) tooth, with bacteria invading the pulp cavity Foreign material stuck in the mouth, such as bone pieces, sticks, metal, plant material, hair Skin abscesses Any type of penetrating trauma, such as bite wounds or stepping on a foreign object Excessive licking or chewing due to skin allergies Anal sac abscesses Thick anal sac material blocking the duct (tube) through which the anal sac empties How Veterinarians Diagnose Abscesses in Dogs Abscesses are typically identified during a physical exam. If a firm lump is found, your vet may perform a fine needle aspirate, which involves inserting a needle into the mass to collect cells. The sample is then evaluated under a microscope to determine what type of cells are present. Abscess samples contain a lot of white blood cells, and bacteria or fungal organisms may be seen. If an abscess does not respond to initial treatment, fluid or material from the site can be put in the incubator to culture (grow) the bacteria involved. Then, antibiotics are tested to see which will be most effective. Bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics can be found in dogs, just as in humans. Treatment of Abscesses in Dogs There are multiple treatment options a veterinarian may recommend depending on the dog’s diagnosis. One option includes opening and draining the site and removing the source of infection. This may involve extraction of an abscessed tooth, removal of foreign material stuck under the skin, or flushing the anal sac duct to re-open it. Simple skin abscesses may be addressed under local anesthesia, depending on the location. Complicated sites (especially the face) or involved cases (such as dental or large abscesses) will be addressed under general anesthesia. For cleaning hot spots, trimming away the hair can often be done without any form of anesthesia. There are some hot spots, however, that are very painful, and the dog may benefit from sedation for clipping/cleaning of the site. Often, oral antibiotics are administered to a dog with an abscess. Pain medication, including an anti-inflammatory medication, is also important. Also, warm compresses applied to a painful, inflamed site help to enhance blood flow and clean the area. This is frequently recommended for the pet parent to do at home for several days. Recovery and Management of Abscesses in Dogs Usually, once the cause of the abscess is addressed and the dog is on appropriate treatment, an abscess starts to resolve quickly, within 2-3 days. The dog should start feeling better quickly as well. Your vet will likely want to recheck your dog a week or two into treatment to see how the abscess site looks. For long-term management, your vet will make recommendations regarding future dental care (for a dental abscess), routine anal sac expression (for an anal sac abscess), and skin allergy management (for hot spots). Abscesses in Dogs FAQs Can an abscess be fatal for a dog? External abscesses are not usually fatal. Internal abscesses, such as inside the chest or abdomen, are more likely to be. Is a dog abscess an emergency? External abscesses do not usually need to be seen on emergency basis. Will a dog abscess heal on its own? Small skin abscesses may break open, drain, and heal on their own. However, it is best to have a vet look to see if there is a possible underlying cause that needs to be addressed. Can an abscess spread? An abscess may get larger over time, but it does not usually spread to another area of the body. Are abscesses painful for dogs? Yes.

Large, deep-chested dogs, such as the Siberian Husky , are believed to be more susceptible to spontaneous pneumothorax. If you would like to learn how this disease affects cats, please visit this page in the PetMD health library. Symptoms and Types There are four main categories of pneumothorax: traumatic, spontaneous, closed, and open. Symptoms vary depending on the type of pneumothorax, though some common signs include rapid breathing (tachypnea), difficulty breathing (dyspnea), shallow rapid breathing from the abdomen, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia). Traumatic pneumothorax, which occurs when air accumulates in the pleural space and is due to some sort of trauma, such as a car accident, may be evident by the signs of shock . Dogs with spontaneous pneumothorax, on the other hand, may show sings of lung disease. Spontaneous pneumothorax is due to a non-traumatic cause, and may be primary (meaning it occurs in the absence of some underlying lung disease) or secondary (meaning it is associated with some type of underlying lung disease). Open pneumothorax occurs when there is a defect located in the respiratory system, such as a puncture in the chest wall, resulting in contact between the pleural space and the outside atmosphere; closed pneumothorax, meanwhile, is identified as pneumothorax without any respiratory defects. Traumatic pneumothorax is generally open, while spontaneous pneumothorax is always closed. Another type of pneumothorax is tension pneumothorax, in which air is transferred into the pleural space during regular inhalation, becoming trapped, and creating a one-way transfer of air into the pleural space.

Traumatic pneumothorax may be due to a traumatic incident, such as a car accident, leading to penetrating injuries of the neck or chest. A surgical incision to the chest, or perforation of the esophagus during surgery may also lead to traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax, meanwhile, may be caused by a foreign body in the lung, lung cancer or abscess, lung disease caused by parasites, or the development of blister-like structures in the dog's lungs, known as pulmonary bullae. Diagnosis Two primary diagnostic procedures may be done in cases of suspected pneumothorax: thoracocentesis and bronchoscopy. Thoracocentesis, in which an intravenous (IV) catheter attached to an extension is inserted into the pleural cavity, can confirm diagnosis, and can also be used to remove air from the pleural space. Bronchoscopy involves the use of a thin tube with a tiny camera attached to it, inserted into the airways by way of the mouth. This is best done if there is evidence of tracheal or large airway trauma. Additional diagnostic techniques may include X-ray imaging of the chest, and urine analysis. Treatment Dogs with pneumothorax should be treated in hospital until the accumulation of air in the pleural cavity has stopped or stabilized. As much air as possible should be removed from the pleural space, and oxygen therapy provided until your pet has stabilized. Air removal can be performed via thoracocentesis, in which an intravenous (IV) catheter attached to an extension is inserted into the pleural cavity. In cases of traumatic open pneumothorax, the open wounds in the dog's chest should be cleaned and covered with an airtight bandage as soon as possible, and later surgically repaired. The administration of intravenous (IV) fluids is also often necessary in cases of trauma. Living and Management After initial treatment, the dog's activity should be severely restricted for at least one week to minimize the odds of recurrence. Vital signs, including respiratory rate and pulse, should be monitored for symptoms of recurrence. Further care depends on the type of pneumothorax affecting your dog, and the severity of its health. Your veterinarian will advise you on how to provide aftercare to your dog until the follow-up exam. Prevention One key way to prevent traumatic pneumothorax is to keep dogs confined and away from dangerous areas such as roads, where they are most likely to be injured.",

It can happen to any dog (and it crops up in cats , too), although younger pups and brachycephalic (flat-faced) dogs are at greater risk. The gastric acid, pepsin, bile salts, and other components of the gastrointestinal juices cause damage to the protective lining of the esophagus. This can result in inflammation of the esophagus (esophagitis) .

Mild esophagitis is limited to esophageal lining inflammation, while more severe ulcerative esophagitis causes damage to the deeper layers of the esophagus. Symptoms of acid reflux in dogs include: Regurgitating food Evidence of pain (whining or pacing, for example) Lack of appetite Lip-licking Coughing Change in the sound of the bark Weight loss Causes  of Acid Reflux in Dogs Gastroesophageal reflux can happen when an anesthetic is administered, which causes the sphincter between the stomach and the esophagus to relax. Head-down positioning of the patient during anesthesia, or if the dog hasn’t fasted properly pre-anesthesia, may increase the chances of gastroesophageal reflux. Congenital hiatal hernias also heighten the risk for gastroesophageal reflux. Young dogs may be at greater risk of developing GERD because their gastroesophageal sphincters are still developing. Long-term or chronic vomiting can also cause esophagitis. How Vets Diagnose Acid Reflux in Dogs The best means of diagnosis is generally an endoscopy, an examination that uses a small camera to view the lining of the esophagus and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. This is the most effective way to determine if changes in the lining are consistent with esophagitis due to gastroesophageal reflux. Keep in mind that esophagitis can be caused by other issues aside from acid reflux, such as: Ingestion of a caustic agent A foreign body in the dog’s throat A tumor in the esophagus A hernia next to the esophagus Megaesophagus , a condition in dogs where the muscles of the esophagus do not function properly in pushing food into the stomach Other diseases of the mouth, throat, or stomach Treating Acid Reflux in Dogs Most treatment is done at home. Many dogs respond to eating a low-fat, prescription diet given in small, frequent meals. Dietary fat should be limited because fat stimulates gastric acid secretion. Medications can also help. Drugs known as gastrointestinal pro-kinetic agents help stomach contents move through the organs and strengthen the lower esophageal sphincter. Veterinarians also often recommend medications to reduce stomach acid production and to protect the lining of the esophagus. Managing Acid Reflux in Dogs After initial treatment, continue monitoring for gastroesophageal reflux in your dog, as it may flare up from time to time. Watch for signs of discomfort and the other symptoms of GERD. A continued low-fat, low-protein diet will help prevent future incidences, and high-fat treats should be avoided, as they may worsen gastroesophageal reflux. Some dogs also require long-term treatment with medications. If your dog doesn’t respond to initial medical treatments, follow-up diagnostic testing may be advised. Preventing  Acid Reflux in Dogs High-fat foods can worsen acid reflux. The best way to prevent future flare-ups is a healthy diet that’s low in fat. Also, be sure to keep your dog on any maintenance medications that your veterinarian has recommended. Featured Image: iStock/Mary Swift",

These lesions are often red in color and wet, as saliva and serum leaking from the skin do not allow them to dry. Lick granulomas are typically an oval patch of skin or skin lump found on the front surface of a leg. Occasionally, more than one leg may be affected. Lick granulomas often lead to secondary bacterial or fungal skin infections and ruptured hair follicles. Causes of Acral Lick Granulomas in Dogs Lick granulomas in dogs are caused by multiple factors. This condition is believed to be both physical and psychological in nature. Typically, lick granulomas occur because of boredom , fear, anxiety , or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Underlying conditions that may trigger lick granulomas include: Stress Allergies Skin infections Trauma–injury Pain Behavioral abnormalities Osteoarthritis All of these are often catalysts leading to a dog licking themselves constantly and causing skin lesions. The most common cause for acral lick granulomas is allergy, either environmental or food sensitivity. This condition occurs mainly in medium- to large-breed dogs, most commonly affecting: German Shepherd Doberman Great Dane Labrador Golden Retriever Weimaraner Irish Setter How Veterinarians Diagnose Acral Lick Granulomas in Dogs If your dog has been licking excessively and has developed a skin lesion, that is often enough to diagnose a lick granuloma, as the location and appearance of the lesion is the guide to diagnosis. It’s important to let your vet know everything about your dog’s history, including: Known allergies Recent travel New food or treats New environment Stress or trauma A complete physical examination may help your vet determine the underlying cause of the skin lesion. They may also recommend an x-ray of the limb to check for any arthritis or other bone/joint condition that could be causing pain or discomfort. Skin testing of the lesion itself, such as an acetate test, a skin culture, skin scraping, or a skin biopsy, might be ordered: An acetate test is when a clear piece of tape is used to adhere to the lesion, then removed. The tape is placed on a microscope slide and examined for the presence of bacteria or fungus. A skin culture is when a swab is used to wipe the surface of the skin lesion. The swab is then used to determine which, if any, antibiotics, or antifungal medications would be best to treat your dog’s lick granuloma. Skin scraping is used to diagnose a mite infection. However, in long-term cases of lick granulomas, the affected skin gets so thick that traditional diagnostics are not definitive. If this occurs, a skin biopsy is taken. This is when a piece of the skin is cut away and sent to the lab for analysis. Treatment of Acral Lick Granulomas in Dogs Treatment for a lick granuloma is largely based on the underlying cause. An Elizabethan or inflatable collar is extremely important to prevent further self-harm—both before you can see the vet and afterward, during treatment. Bandages should be placed only with the guidance of your veterinarian, because covering an infected wound traps in moisture, often prevents healing, and can make the condition worse. If your vet suspects that your dog has a food allergy, a food trial will begin, placing your dog on a very limited ingredient diet. It is essential that during this time, all other foods be prohibited from your dog’s diet, including treats. Medications such as antibiotics, antifungals, anti-inflammatory and pain medications, anti-anxiety drugs, and/or antihistamines might be prescribed. Topical therapy with creams, wipes, or shampoos is often recommended to help with infection.. Common antibiotics for skin infections: Cephalexin , Convenia, Simplicef Common allergy medications: Apoquel , Zyrtec, hydroxyzine Antifungal: ketoconazole (oral and topical) Anti-inflammatory: carprofen, prednisone, Temaril-P Pain medication: tramadol, gabapentin Anti-anxiety: alprazolam, fluoxetine, clomipramine Topical antiseptic: chlorhexidine Behavior modification training to assist with psychological concerns such as anxiety or stress may be recommended by your veterinarian if allergies are not the cause. Increasing the amount of exercise and play time your dog gets daily can help, so that they spend less time focused on licking. Your vet may also refer you to a pet behaviorist to help if these behaviors are extreme. CO2 laser and cold laser therapies have been described to help in select dogs. Acupuncture around the affected area also has been helpful in some dogs. Douxo S3 wipes and mousses are great over-the-counter products to use at home, in addition to the collar. You can also bathe your dog with a medicated shampoo, or use a spray to help with itching. On average, treatment of the wound should take 7-14 days. Recovery and Management of Acral Lick Granulomas in Dogs For most dogs, the prognosis for a lick granuloma is guarded; it is rarely life-threatening but it can be very frustrating to both the dog and the pet parent. Determining the best treatment of a lick granuloma often requires trial and error, and several visits to the vet may be necessary to determine the ideal combination of treatments. Often, lick granulomas are managed long-term instead of looking for a full recovery or resolution. It is worth remembering that stressful changes in your dog’s life may lead to recurrence of the problem. Your dog’s mouth is full of bacteria and other harmful pathogens, so it’s important to always keep a protective collar on your dog, especially when they are alone or at night, to prevent further licking and infecting the wound. If left untreated, continued licking can also cause serious infection in the skin’s underlying muscles and bones. Dogs with a lick granuloma that get early treatment have a better prognosis for recovery than dogs with a chronic or severe condition. Prevention of Acral Lick Granulomas in Dogs For dogs that are predisposed to having lick granulomas for behavioral reasons, allowing them more time to actively play or walking them longer to tire them out helps to decrease the amount of time they can focus on licking. All dogs should have an exam done by their veterinarian at least once a year, as this can help catch medical conditions early to prevent secondary licking behaviors. An exam should also be performed at the first sign of any illness or skin condition to help prevent this issue as well. Most arthritis, behavioral, or allergy medications that are proven to help need to be used lifelong to prevent unwanted behaviors such as the repetitive licking that causes lick granulomas. If your veterinarian suspects that stress is causing your dog’s behavior, it’s important to evaluate your dog’s environment and remove stressors wherever possible. If your dog has arthritis, this condition may be managed by medications, gradual weight loss, soft bedding, massage, and diet. Featured Image: iStock/Cristian Blázquez Martínez WRITTEN BY Barri J.

Your veterinarian will evaluate your dog's condition and start emergency treatment at once. You will need to provide your veterinarian with a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as trauma to any part of the body, or inhalation of gases, fumes, or solid matter. Along with the emergency treatment your veterinarian will work to find the underlying cause for the sudden lung failure. Various laboratory test panels will be ordered, including blood tests, serum biochemical tests, urine tests and blood gas analysis. Blood gas analysis is one of the most important diagnostic methods used in veterinary practice for the diagnosis of ARDS. Your veterinarian will also order chest X-rays and echocardiography in order to visually examine and evaluate the functioning capability of the lungs and heart. Treatment Dogs suffering from this syndrome will need emergency treatment in an intensive care unit. Along with emergency treatment, the underlying cause must be established and treated in order to prevent further complications or death. Despite recent advances, ARDS remains one of the most difficult and challenging problems to treat in veterinary practice. Supplemental oxygen therapy will be started immediately to minimize the respiratory distress. If your dog does not respond well to the oxygen therapy and continues to have severe breathing problems, there may be more success with ventilator supported breathing. Medications for treating ARDS include antibiotics, pain killers, fluid therapy, and corticosteroids for reducing inflammation and swelling. Frequent readings of temperature, pulse, respiration rate, and blood pressure will be necessary for following your dog's progress in the initial stage of the treatment. If your dog has been placed on ventilator support it may also require regular physiotherapy sessions and frequent changes in body position to prevent complications related to ventilator support. Dogs affected with ARDS are kept in strict cage confinement until they have fully recovered. Living and Management ARDS is a very serious health problem needing constant support from your side for the successful treatment, management and care of the condition. Be sure to follow your veterinarian’s guidelines closely, and if you are in doubt, consult with the doctor. If an underlying disease has not been conclusively diagnosed and resolved, another episode of respiratory distress may follow. Dogs that have been affected, and have survived this condition usually need time, rest, and good nutrition to fully recover. Do not confine your dog to stuffy or hot places, and allow your dog to signal when it has had enough walking or exercise. Some dogs will have scarring of the lungs even after the condition has been resolved, a condition referred to as fibrosis, and the tissue of the lungs will be stiffer and less capable of holding oxygen. Following the diet and management recommendations made by your veterinarian, and keeping activity minimal will be the best course for preventing a recurrence.",

    "content": "Addison’s disease in dogs is a condition caused by a deficiency in steroid hormones. These hormones are produced by the adrenal glands, tiny organs near the kidneys. Steroid hormones, specifically cortisol and aldosterone, are produced to counteract stress and to maintain electrolyte balance. Key Takeaways Addison’s disease in dogs is a condition caused by a deficiency in steroid hormones. Many cases of Addison’s disease are idiopathic, meaning they develop without a known cause. Unfortunately, Addison’s disease in dogs is not a preventable condition. What Is Addison’s Disease in Dogs? Addison’s disease generally develops when a dog’s immune system attacks and destroys the adrenal glands. It’s most common in female dogs who are young to middle-aged. Dogs with symptoms of Addison’s disease should be seen promptly by a veterinarian. If the disease is left untreated, affected dogs can experience an Addisonian crisis, which is a life-threatening condition that warrants immediate medical attention. Addisonian Crisis in Dogs An Addisonian crisis, due to lack of steroid hormones, refers to an abrupt onset of worrisome symptoms, such as weakness or collapse, vomiting, extreme lethargy, and trembling. This can occur if Addison’s disease is left untreated and the dog no longer can cope with stress. It is considered a medical emergency that warrants immediate treatment. Symptoms of Addison’s Disease in Dogs Addison’s disease in dogs causes a variety of symptoms, which include the following: Increased thirst Increased urination Trembling Lethargy Weakness Decreased appetite Diarrhea (which causes significant loss of sodium and water) Vomiting Weight loss Abdominal pain Collapse Causes of Addison’s Disease in Dogs Many cases of Addison’s disease are idiopathic, meaning they develop without a known cause. However, it is likely that any of the following reasons may contribute to the disease in dogs: Immune-mediated —Dogs can develop Addison’s disease when their own immune system attacks their adrenal glands. Adrenal gland damage —Anything that causes damage to the adrenal glands— including infection, cancer , or inadequate blood supply—can result in Addison’s disease. Medication —Dogs who are given medication to treat another endocrine disorder, Cushing’s disease , may develop Addison’s disease if the dosage is inappropriate or if the medication is taken long-term and then stopped abruptly. Pituitary gland disease —The pituitary gland, a tiny gland situated at the base of the brain, produces hormones that stimulate the adrenal glands. If there is a problem within the pituitary gland, the adrenal glands might not be stimulated to produce steroid hormones, which can then result in Addison’s disease. Breed predisposition —Several breeds, including Great Danes , Standard Poodles , and West Highland White Terriers , are at an increased risk for developing Addison’s disease, likely due to genetics. How Veterinarians Diagnose Addison’s Disease in Dogs If you are concerned that your pup may have Addison’s disease, consult your veterinarian. Be sure to discuss when your dog’s symptoms began and whether your dog has been taking any medications. Your veterinarian will complete a thorough physical exam to check for abnormalities, such as dehydration or weakness. If your veterinarian suspects Addison’s disease, they will order diagnostic testing, which might include: Blood work —Your vet can take a small sample of blood to look for signs of dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, anemia , or increased kidney values. Urinalysis —Your vet can take a urine sample to check your dog’s urine concentration. Addison’s disease results in less concentrated urine than normal, since your pup is drinking more water. ACTH stimulation —Your vet will take a sample of blood to check resting cortisol levels. Then they will inject a medication called ACTH , wait an hour, and collect another blood sample. Dogs with Addison’s disease will have low cortisol values for both blood draws. This is the preferred method of confirming a diagnosis of Addison’s disease. Imaging —Your vet might order tests such as ultrasound to check for abnormally small adrenal glands, which would indicate an underlying disease. Treatment of Addison’s Disease in Dogs Addison’s disease in dogs can’t be cured. It must be managed for the remainder of your dog’s life. Treatment is based on the severity of symptoms and the stage of disease. Dogs with early Addison’s disease typically receive oral steroids, such as prednisone , and a monthly steroid injection at a veterinary hospital.

They might also be given antacids , such as famotidine , and supplemental glucose. After your pup’s diagnosis of Addison’s disease and initial treatment, your vet will recheck your dog’s blood work in about a month to make sure the dosage of medications is appropriate to control the disease.

Dogs who do not receive treatment or who come to the veterinary hospital in an Addisonian crisis can quickly die, so prompt intervention is key. Fortunately, with prompt treatment, most dogs do fully recover. If your pup has Addison’s disease, it’s important to bring them to the vet on time for their monthly injections and to give oral medications exactly as prescribed to best manage this disease. Prevention of Addison’s Disease in Dogs Unfortunately, Addison’s disease in dogs is not a preventable condition. It’s likely there is an underlying hereditary component to the disease, but the true cause is unknown. However, regular veterinary checkups promote your dog’s overall health. They allow a veterinarian to catch early signs of disease so that appropriate treatment can be started before conditions progress in severity. Addison’s Disease in Dogs FAQs How long can a dog live with Addison’s disease? Dogs can live a normal lifespan with Addison’s disease if they receive appropriate treatment and regular veterinary checkups for the remainder of their life. What breed of dog is prone to Addison’s disease? Several breeds of dogs are at an increased risk of developing Addison’s disease, including Great Danes, Standard Poodles, and West Highland White Terriers.

      "Adenocarcinomas in dogs commonly look like raised, irregularly shaped masses, but they may also look like a skin ulcer or sore. They can appear anywhere on the body, but are most commonly found in a dog’s “armpit” where their legs meet their bodies and in the groin area.

They are usually not painful when touched but may occasionally bleed or ooze. Causes of Sweat Gland or Sebaceous Adenocarcinoma in Dogs There are no known causes of sebaceous in dogs. However, they often occur more frequently in older animals and some breeds are predisposed to developing sweat gland sebaceous adenocarcinoma. How Veterinarians Diagnose Sweat Gland, Sebaceous Adenocarcinoma in Dogs If your vet suspects a skin adenocarcinoma, they will perform an examination. This may include reviewing the dog’s health record and discussing any symptoms you’ve noticed, including difficulty swallowing or eating, bad breath, etc. Fine Needle Biopsy You veterinarian may perform a fine needle biopsy to collect cells from the tumor to examine under a microscope. During this test, the vet will insert a very fine needle into the tumor to collect a small sample of cells. The cells will be examined under a microscope to determine if they are cancerous. Surgical Biopsy Your veterinarian may also perform a surgical procedure to remove all, or a piece, of the tumor. The removed tissue will be sent to a medical provider called a pathologist who specializes in examining tissue to determine if the tumor is an adenocarcinoma. Treatment for Sweat Gland or Sebaceous Adenocarcinoma in Dogs Surgical procedure Surgical removal of the tumor is the most common treatment of skin adenocarcinomas. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy may also be recommended if your veterinarian was unable to remove all of the tumor or the cancer has spread (also called metastasized) to your dog’s lymph nodes. Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy may also be prescribed to treat a skin adenocarcinoma. Recovery and Management of Sweat Gland, Sebaceous Adenocarcinoma in Dogs Following surgery, your veterinarian may prescribe medicine to ease pain and reduce inflammation, along with antibiotics to prevent infection. Your dog may also require a follow-up visit with your veterinarian to inspect the surgical site and ensure proper healing. What Is the Survival Rate for Skin Adenocarcinoma in Dogs? Your dog should recover completely if a sweat gland, sebaceous adenocarcinoma is completely removed before the cancer spreads to other parts of the body. In rare instances, a sebaceous adenocarcinoma spreads to nearby parts of the body, but it can also spread throughout a larger portion of a dog’s body. Adenocarcinoma of the Sebaceous and Sweat Glands in Dogs FAQs How long can a dog live after being diagnosed with sweat gland, sebaceous  adenocarcinoma? Most dogs live full lives after diagnosis and treatment for sebaceous  adenocarcinomas. How aggressive is sweat gland, sebaceous adenocarcinoma in dogs? Skin adenocarcinomas are locally invasive and spread easily to nearby lymph nodes, but they generally do not metastasize to other parts of the body. Is sweat skin adenocarcinoma curable in dogs? Yes, skin adenocarcinomas are curable with surgical removal and chemotherapy, if required. References Tumors of the Skin in Dogs – Dog Owners . Merck Veterinary Manual. David M. Vail; Stephen J.

Symptoms Symptoms will depend on the immunologic status of the host and degree of initial injury to the cells (cytotoxic): Peracute (very severe) stage will have symptoms of fever , central nervous system signs, collapse of blood vessels, coagulation disorder (DIC); death frequently occurs within hours Acute (severe) stage will show symptoms of fever, anorexia , lethargy, vomiting , diarrhea , enlarged liver, abdominal pain, abdominal fluid, inflammation of the vessels (vasculitis), pinpoint red dots, bruising of skin (petechia), DIC, swollen, enlarged lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), and rarely, inflammation of the brain (nonsuppurative encephalitis) Uncomplicated infection will have symptoms of lethargy, anorexia, transient fever, tonsillitis, vomiting, diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, enlarged liver, abdominal pain Late stage infection will result in 20 percent of cases developing eye inflammation and corneal swelling four to six days postinfection; recovery often within 21 days, but may progress to glaucoma and corneal ulceration Vet Recommended Health Support Purina Pro Plan Veterinary Diets FortiFlora Powder Probiotic Digestive Supplement for Dogs, 30 count Rated 4.8 out of 5 stars 9855 Reviews $30.99 Chewy Price Shop on Chewy VetClassics Pet-A-Lyte Oral Electrolyte Solution Dog & Cat Supplement, 32-oz bottle Rated 4.1 out of 5 stars 59 Reviews $17.99 Chewy Price Shop on Chewy Nutramax Welactin Omega-3 Liquid Skin & Coat Supplement for Dogs, 16-fl oz Rated 4.7 out of 5 stars 1562 Reviews $27.99 Chewy Price Shop on Chewy Fera Pets USDA Organic Pumpkin Plus Fiber Support for Dogs & Cats, 90 servings Rated 4.3 out of 5 stars 168 Reviews $34.95 Chewy Price Shop on Chewy Causes Contact with infectious CAV-1 adenovirus Unvaccinated dogs are at highest risk Diagnosis You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, previous illnesses, and possible incidents that might have led to this condition. Contact with other dogs, such as in kennels, or frequency of contact with feces, such as in open spaces where dogs are permitted to defecate, may play a role in acquiring this virus. Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, with standard laboratory work. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, a urinalysis and an electrolyte panel. Other laboratory work that will need to be done to confirm a diagnosis of infectious hepatitis include coagulation tests to check for the clotting function of the blood, serology for antibodies to CAV-1, viral isolation of the virus cells, and viral culture. Your doctor will be checking for other common diseases as well, including parvovirus and distemper. Imaging techniques will include an abdominal radiography to look for enlargement of the liver (hepatomegaly) and fluid buildup in the abdominal cavity, and abdominal ultrasonography, which can give a more detailed view of the liver and whether it is enlarged of is suffering from necrosis (cell death). The latter technique is especially necessary if there is abdominal swelling, as the radiography will show a reduced image detail if there is fluid blocking the view to the liver, where ultrasound imaging will return information based on the depth of frequency of the echo, based on the structure of the tissues. That is, cellular/tissue death in the liver will show decreased echo (hypoechoeic), and severe fluid build up in the abdomen will not return any echoes (anechoic). A liver biopsy may also need to be performed to make a conclusive diagnosis. Treatment If the infection is in the very early stage and is uncomplicated, treatment may be given on an outpatient basis. However, treatment is usually given inpatient. Fluid therapy will be given for electrolyte imbalances that result from vomiting and diarrhea. Potassium and magnesium are often very low and need to be supplement immediately. Blood component therapy will be given for coagulopathy (disorders in the blood's ability to clot). With overt DIC, fresh blood products and low molecular weight heparin will need to be sued to stabilize your dog's condition. Nutritional support will include giving frequent small meals as tolerated, optimizing nitrogen intake, and feeding the dog according to protein needs. The amount of protein will depend entirely on your dog's individual condition, as some dogs will have high protein in the body and some will have low. Inappropriate protein restriction may impair tissue repair and regeneration. Nitrogen will be restricted if your dog is showing obvious signs of hepatic encephalopathy (a neuropsychiatric abnormality that causes inflammation of the brain and is related to liver failure). Partial intravenous nutrition will be given for a maximum of five days, or preferably, total intravenous nutrition if oral feeding is not tolerated by the dog. Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics and/or fluid reducers as necessary. Living and Management The veterinarian will schedule follow up visits to monitor fluid, electrolyte, acid-base, and coagulation status, and to adjust supportive measures. Sudden kidney failure will also need to be monitored for. A highly digestible diet will need to be fed to your dog during recovery, and a safe place set aside to rest and recover from the illness. Restrict your dog's activity during the recovery period, as well as access to other pets. be especially mindful about cleaning up after your dog, as the virus can continue to be shed long after the recovery period. Prevention of this infection requires a a modified live virus vaccination for this disease at six to eight weeks of age. The initial vaccination is followed by two booster shots given at three to four weeks apart until the dog reaches 16 weeks of age, with an additional booster given at one year. This is a highly effective vaccine.",

Most commonly, tumors secrete cortisol, which is a steroid. Overproduction of steroids leads to: Increased thirst Increased urination Increased hunger Weight gain Pot-belly appearance Skin issues Urinary tract infections Hair loss More serious tumors, called pheochromocytomas, secrete fight-or-flight hormones like adrenaline. These symptoms may be vague, and wax and wane. At times, the dog may even seem normal, but these types of tumors have profound cardiac and other manifestations, such as: Abnormal heart rate and rhythm leading to weakness and collapse Increased blood pressure leading to behavior changes or blindness Increased thirst and urination Weight loss and decreased appetite Seizures Panting Fever Cough Gastrointestinal signs Tumors secreting aldosterone result in high blood pressure and low potassium. Pet parents may notice: Weakness Blindness secondary to high blood pressure Lethargy “Dropped” legs in the back Abnormal neck flexion Collapse Causes of Adrenal Gland Tumors in Dogs Causes of adrenal gland tumors are mostly unknown. However, there may be a genetic predisposition to adrenal tumors and environmental, diet, or medication factors that make certain animals more prone to develop them. More studies and research are needed to better understand the cause of these diseases. How Veterinarians Diagnose Adrenal Gland Tumors in Dogs Most adrenal gland tumors are found with an ultrasound, which can assess size, shape, and structure. However, while ultrasound can confirm the presence of a tumor in the adrenals, it can only lead veterinarians to an educated guess about the type. Benign adenomas are typically small and noninvasive. Carcinomas are usually bigger and can invade the surrounding tissue. Tumors typically only affect one, not both, adrenal glands. A biopsy is required for a definitive diagnosis, although not all dogs are candidates for this procedure. Based on the clinical signs and severity of the disease, other important tests to diagnose adrenal tumors include: Routine blood chemistry and complete blood count Blood pressure measurements X-rays of the chest and abdomen to evaluate for cancerous spread Cardiac consultation to rule out heart failure Advanced imaging to determine the extent of invasive tumors Hormone testing Endocrine testing, such as an ACTH Stimulation test or Low-Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test Treatment of Adrenal Gland Tumors in Dogs Removal of the affected adrenal gland (adrenalectomy) is the treatment of choice. However, surgery may not be an option if the tumor has invaded major blood vessels or other organs or spread to distant sites (metastasis). An adrenalectomy is a serious surgery and should be performed by a surgical specialist at a 24-hour facility, as complications during and after surgery are common. For dogs who are not candidates for surgery, medical management may be beneficial for a period of time. However, fatal complications, such as blood clots and arrhythmias, may occur at any time. Dogs with adrenal-dependent Cushing's disease may improve clinically on the drugs mitotane or trilostane, which work to suppress cortisol. Dogs with nonresectable pheochromocytomas may benefit from drugs to treat their clinical signs, such as blood pressure or cardiac arrhythmias. Dogs with nonresectable adrenal tumors secreting aldosterone may benefit from drugs like spirinolactone that help block the receptors for aldosterone. Supportive care may be required during acute crises. Many dogs need to stay in a veterinary hospital on IV fluids, medications, and supplements. Recovery and Management of Adrenal Gland Tumors in Dogs Dogs with benign, nonfunctional tumors have the best prognosis, followed by dogs with benign, functional tumors. Hyperaldosteronism is rare, and the prognosis is usually uncertain. Cushing’s disease, caused by a benign tumor, is commonly well-managed by surgery or medications followed by periodic exams and testing. Prognosis is good for these animals if symptoms are controlled. Dogs with malignant tumors causing Cushing’s disease have a worse prognosis, with relatively high metastatic rates. Some of these dogs may live for a few years after diagnosis and adrenal removal, and just over a year if managed with medication alone. Dogs with pheochromocytomas have a guarded to poor prognosis, as these are typically invasive and metastatic, with many severe side effects causing a poor quality of life. About 20-30% of dogs may not survive the surgery to remove the tumor. Dogs that do survive surgery have an average survival of around 1 year, with less than 60% surviving longer than 3 years. Survival time decreases as the tumor size increases. Adrenal Gland Tumors in Dogs FAQs Are adrenal gland tumors in dogs painful? Tumors themselves likely do not cause dogs pain. However, secondary complications of tumors may cause them discomfort and a decreased quality of life. How serious is a tumor on the adrenal gland? Some tumors are life-threatening; the majority are less serious but still require medical attention and treatment. How long do dogs live with adrenal cancer? Depending on the type and treatment, dogs with adrenal cancer may live for months to years. References Bruyette D. Merck Veterinary Manual. Disorders of the Adrenal Glands in Dogs . June 2018.

There are two species of Acanthamoeba that are free-living: A. castellani and A. culbertsoni. These species can be found in freshwater, saltwater, soil and sewage. Dogs can be infected by ingesting or inhaling contaminated water, soil or sewage. Colonization of the dog’s skin by Acanthamoeba can occur and can be a cause of infection. Colonization of the cornea of the eye by Acanthamoeba can occur and can be a cause of infection. The infection can be spread through the blood stream (hematogenous spread.) Infection of the nose can spread into the brain. Young dogs and those that are immunosuppressed are the most likely to become ill. Diagnosis Blood testing (complete blood cell count and blood chemistry profile) and urine testing (urinatlysis) are usually performed and are often normal although evidence of dehydration, if present, can be seen in these tests. Other laboratory tests your veterinarian may recommend include: Biopsies of the colon obtained by colonoscopy (examination of the colon with a long cylindrical scope with a light.) Biopsies may reveal damage to the intestinal lining as well as trophozoites (a stage in the life cycle of the infecting organism.) fecal examination looking for trophozoites. Trophozoites can be difficult to find in the feces. Special stains are often used to increase their visibility. central spinal fluid (CSF) taps. Infections involving the meningoencephalitis form of the disease may show abnormalities, including an elevated white blood cell count, abnormal protein levels and xanthochromia. MRI of the brain may reveal granulomas in the meningoencephalitis form. brain biopsies. Treatment Metronidazole is used to control the symptoms of colitis and is usually successful. However, the systemic forms of the disease (i.e. infections that are spread via the blood stream) are usually fatal despite treatment although symptomatic treatment can be attempted.",

Dogs may also find and ingest medication from pill bottles left on countertops and in other accessible areas. Occasionally, the drug may be given to the dog purposely. Diagnosis After asking you questions regarding the dog's medical history, your veterinarian will observe the animal for clinical signs consistent with amphetamine ingestion. Blood, urine or stomach contents can be tested for the presence of amphetamines, but it generally takes several days for results to be obtained. Therefore, treatment for amphetamine poisoning must be initiated before these results are returned. Treatment If ingestion has just occurred and the dog is still ambulatory and not having seizures, vomiting may be induced using apomorphine, hydrogen peroxide, or ipecac. Consult your veterinarian for instructions. Activated charcoal may be used to adsorb the poison in the stomach. Gastric lavage (“pumping the stomach”) may be necessary as well. Your veterinarian may administer intravenous fluid therapy in order to dilute the toxicity; he or she may also administer sedatives and/or anticonvulsants to control seizures and reduce stimulation of the nervous system. If the dog’s body temperature rises to dangerous levels, cooling measures may be necessary. Finally, your veterinarian will want to monitor your dog’s blood chemistry results. Kidney function tests must be closely monitored in dogs poisoned with amphetamines. Additionally, blood pressure and body temperature must be monitored. Living and Management Once returned home, a dog that has suffered from amphetamine poisoning must be kept in a calm quiet atmosphere to facilitate recovery. Prevention In order to prevent accidental amphetamine poisoning, keep all prescription medications secured in a location inaccessible to your dog.",

Anal gland cancer can affect both male and female dogs. It is more commonly found in the following breeds: German Shepherd Alaskan Malamute Dachshund Dogs in the Spaniel family, such as: English Cocker Spaniel Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Springer Spaniel Symptoms of Anal Gland Cancer in Dogs Symptoms of anal cancer in dogs include: Discomfort in the area around the anus (perianal region) Anal discharge Scooting across the floor Licking around the perianal area Straining to poop Constipation Anal gland cancer may be hard to detect at home. Instead, a mass in the anal region may be noted during a routine vet examination. If the tumor is large enough, it may look like swelling in the anal region. It may also interfere with your dog’s ability to defecate, or it may cause ribbon-shaped stool. In about 25% of anal gland adenocarcinoma cases, dogs will also have an elevated blood calcium level. Elevated calcium in dogs may cause increased thirst and urination, as well as decreased energy level and appetite. Elevated calcium levels in dogs can be harmful to your animal. If high calcium levels are not medically addressed, your dog is at risk of kidney failure or damage. How Veterinarians Diagnose Anal Gland Cancer in Dogs Anal gland cancer in dogs is usually diagnosed when your vet feels a mass during a rectal exam or you or your vet notice swelling in the anal region caused by the mass. To diagnose anal gland cancer in your dog, your vet will collect cells from the mass during a procedure called a fine needle aspirate. During this procedure, a thin needle is inserted into the affected gland and used to collect a small sample of cells. These cells are then examined under a microscope. If your vet still suspects cancer after the fine needle aspirate, they will confirm the diagnosis and determine the exact type of cancer. This will require a procedure called a biopsy with histopathology, meaning they will collect more cells and closely examine them. Bloodwork, abdominal ultrasound, and chest x-rays may also be recommended. The bloodwork looks at the overall health of your dog’s organs, including calcium levels, which may be high due to the cancer. Chest x-rays can detect cancer that has spread to the lungs or other nearby organs. An abdominal ultrasound can show if the cancer has spread to internal organs and lymph nodes. Consultation with a board-certified veterinary oncologist is recommended when anal sac cancer is diagnosed. Treatment for Anal Gland Cancer in Dogs When a dog is diagnosed with anal gland cancer, surgical removal of the anal gland and sac are recommended. Removing the tumor can help your dog live longer and can lower elevated calcium levels. If the cancer has spread to local lymph nodes, they will also likely be removed with surgery. If the cancer has already spread to other parts of your dog’s body, surgery to remove the anal gland mass may still be performed to make your dog more comfortable, but it might not prolong their life span. Recovery and Management of Anal Gland Cancer in Dogs Chemotherapy is frequently recommended to prevent further spread or recurrence. In cases where surgery is not possible, radiation therapy may be recommended to shrink your dog’s tumor. Anal Gland Cancer in Dogs FAQs How long do dogs live with anal gland adenocarcinoma? If surgery is performed to remove the tumor, and there’s no evidence of metastasis (spread), dogs can live 1-2 years. How aggressive is anal gland cancer in dogs? Anal gland adenocarcinomas are very aggressive and invade tissues around the tumor. They also have a high rate of metastasis (spread). Anal cancer in dogs can spread to any part of the body but usually spreads to local lymph nodes first. Is perianal/anal sac adenocarcinoma curable in dogs? Anal gland cancer can be curable in rare cases if it’s caught in the very early stages and treated aggressively with surgery plus chemotherapy. References Vail DM, Thamm DH, Liptak JM.

The most common compound released is histamine. In smaller doses histamine causes hives and itching, but when released in large amounts it dilates blood vessels, increases heart rate, and causes low blood pressure. In most species, anaphylaxis primarily affects the lungs and airways; however, in dogs the gastrointestinal tract often releases histamine directly into the liver, causing symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea as well as liver enzyme elevations to be more commonly seen. Severe vomiting , diarrhea, and lethargy may occur suddenly and appear to come out of nowhere. If allowed to progress, this can lead to collapse, convulsions, and even death. Other symptoms of anaphylaxis in dogs include facial swelling, itching, and hives, which may or may not progress to difficulty in breathing. Though these effects are more likely to occur in less severe cases of hypersensitivity, they still warrant prompt evaluation by a veterinarian. Causes of Anaphylaxis in Dogs In theory, any foreign molecule can trigger an anaphylactic reaction, though a dog must have been exposed to this trigger at least twice before shock can occur. Most canine reactions are to insect bites or stings (commonly bees, wasps, and venomous ants), medications, antigens in vaccines, or chemicals. Anaphylaxis related to food proteins is very rare, though it has been documented. How Veterinarians Diagnose Anaphylaxis in Dogs Diagnosis of anaphylactic shock is usually based on clinical signs, physical exam, and history of exposure to an allergen (if the allergy is known). Blood tests may help confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating dehydration or liver enzyme elevations, though these tests can also be normal. Inflammation of the liver and gallbladder may be seen on an abdominal ultrasound. Treatment of Anaphylaxis in Dogs Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency, and immediate attention is essential to survival . Your vet will use a combination of medications to reduce the immune response and counteract the symptoms. Epinephrine and corticosteroids such as dexamethasone are commonly used for this purpose. If a dog has progressed to anaphylactic shock, intravenous fluids may be needed to maintain blood pressure. Severe airway swelling may require a breathing tube, sedation, and even ventilation to ensure your pet can breathe. Recovery and Management of Anaphylaxis in Dogs Prognosis will depend on the severity of the reaction and how quickly care is managed. Mild cases may respond to treatment without hospitalization, while aggressively treated animals may still succumb to a particularly severe reaction. Histamine released in the system works rapidly and if the effects of this compound aren’t counteracted by medications and support very quickly, the decreased blood pressure can give the body further signals to shut down, and these are harder to combat. In the hospital, severely affected patients are usually observed and treated for at least 2-3 days to make sure that no delayed effects are noted. Anaphylactic and allergic reactions worsen with repeat exposures, so allergy testing may be worthwhile in recovered dogs who experienced severe symptoms. Avoidance of the allergen, if possible, is best. For allergens that are difficult to avoid, discuss an emergency plan with your veterinarian. This may include medications such as steroids or an Epi-pen that can be kept at home for immediate use.

Your veterinarian will perform a physical examination with full laboratory testing, including complete blood tests, biochemical profiles, and urinalysis. The results of these tests will provide valuable information for the preliminary diagnosis. The count of various cells will be determined; counts that are far below the normal ranges are considered a positive result. Your veterinarian will also evaluate your dog for the presence of any infectious diseases, but the most valuable test in the diagnosis of aplastic anemia is bone marrow sampling. In this test a small sample of bone marrow will be collected through aspiration or biopsy. The microscopic studies will reveal the important information related to the architecture of the bone marrow and any developmental problems of the various cells in the bone marrow. Treatment Your veterinarian will start treating your dog immediately after a confirmatory diagnosis has been made. Your dog may need to be hospitalized for few days to be monitored and treated. With aplastic anemia, there are number of problems to deal with and supportive therapy will be initiated to provide the required nutrition and energy that your dog is lacking. If required, whole blood transfusions may be recommended for severely anemic patients. As this problem is mediated mostly through the immune system, the primary treatment involves suppressing the immune system with drugs like cyclosporine A. Cyclosporine and other related agents suppress the bone marrow’s over-response. Drugs supporting the bone marrow functions are also recommended for these patients. Antibiotics are given to treat ongoing infections as well as for the prevention of further infections. Living and Management During hospitalization, your veterinarian will monitor your dog's status daily. Blood tests will be repeated to determine the current status of the problem. In some dogs, bone marrow sampling may need to be repeated in order to see if the bone marrow is responding normally or not. Unfortunately, with aplastic anemia few patients survive despite extensive care and treatment. Young dogs have a better chance of survival, but even if initial recovery is attained, it may take several weeks to months for a complete recovery.",

RBCs are produced in the bone marrow and carry oxygen to all tissues in the body. Dogs show signs of anemia in various ways, based on its cause, severity, and duration. As anemia worsens, dogs show clinical signs of shock and failing cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Anemia can be severe and life-threatening. Seek veterinary care immediately if your pet has pale gums, is struggling to breathe, is actively bleeding, or has unusual bruising. In general, there are three ways that a dog can be anemic: RBC loss : The bone marrow produces normal amounts of RBCs, but they are lost or leak outside the blood vessels. RBC destruction : The body destroys the RBCs too soon. RBC decreased production : The bone marrow does not make enough RBCs. In addition to these general types, anemia may be described by how responsive the bone marrow is. In regenerative anemia , the bone marrow correctly responds to the decreased RBC count and starts making new RBCs. In nonregenerative anemia , the bone marrow does not produce enough RBCs.

Dogs with chronic conditions may have vague, or no clinical signs until the anemia becomes severe. These dogs can acclimate to lower RBC counts over a longer period, whereas a dog with an acute blood loss may immediately show signs of distress and illness. Common signs of anemia in dogs include: Weakness Lethargy Decreased appetite Pica (eating non-food items) Weight loss Pale mucous membranes (gums) Increased heart rate Increased respiratory (breathing) rate Difficulty breathing Collapse Small or large bruising over the body (petechiae and ecchymoses) Jaundice (buildup of yellow coloring in blood and tissue) Blood loss from nose, mouth, or urogenital or gastrointestinal systems Causes of Anemia in Dogs Anemia occurs in all breeds, ages, and genders of dogs. Some breeds are predisposed to a certain type of anemia, called Immune-mediated Hemolytic Anemia (IMHA) including: American Cocker Spaniel Miniature Schnauzer Collie Doberman Pinscher English Springer Spaniel Poodle Bichon Frise Miniature Pinscher Old English Sheepdog Maltese Blood loss , when acute, occurs secondary to trauma, surgery, coagulopathies (poor clotting), rodenticide toxicity, a ruptured spleen, and bleeding cancers (hemangiosarcoma). Chronic blood loss can also lead to anemia in cases of long-term gastrointestinal ulcers, parasites ( hookworms and fleas), tumors, lack of nutrition, and some drugs. RBC destruction occurs when normal RBCs are removed from the system inappropriately and too early. Normally, RBCs last around 110 to 115 days in dogs and are removed by the spleen, liver, or bone marrow when they are old. Common examples of this type of anemia are: IMHA occurs when the immune system attacks the red blood cells. This can happen secondary to a trigger, such as some drugs, infections, cancers, or inflammatory diseases. It can also occur with no clear cause. RBC parasites, such as babesia, can induce anemia. Oxidative stress causes anemia and occurs in onion/garlic toxicities, acetaminophen and benzocaine toxicities, and zinc toxicosis, for example. Oxidative stress causes the normal oxygen-carrying hemoglobin to change to methemoglobin, which cannot bind or deliver oxygen to cells. Mechanical damage can occur to RBCs in heartworm disease, vasculitis, cardiac disease, liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and in some cancers. Other causes of RBC destruction include some infections, incompatible blood transfusions, genetic RBC abnormalities and disorders, diabetic ketoacidosis, propofol administration, and hypophosphatemia (low phosphorus). Decreased RBC production occurs when the bone marrow does not make enough RBCs. This type is, inherently, nonregenerative. The following can all affect the body’s ability to produce RBCs: Chronic inflammatory diseases Chronic kidney disease Hypothyroidism Addison’s disease Immune conditions Infection Cancer Bone marrow suppression via infectious agents, drugs, and toxicities such as: Infectious agents— Parvovirus , babesia , ehrlichia Drugs—Chemotherapy agents, lead, methimazole, phenobarbital, fenbendazole, TMS, albendazole How Veterinarians Diagnose Anemia in Dogs Often, veterinarians may suspect anemia based on a patient’s history and clinical exam findings—especially if the dog has pale gums, bruising, or obvious abdominal tumors. However, anemia is only diagnosed by performing bloodwork to assess the RBC count as well other RBC factors such as size, shape, and color, which may help find the severity, chronicity, or cause of the anemia. Complete blood count (CBC) : This test looks at multiple RBC factors. These all help the veterinarian to chart the best plan of treatment for anemia. PCV/TS : This is a relatively easy and quick diagnostic tool to look at the packed cell volume, which is another way to monitor the RBCs. Reticulocyte count : This test looks for increased numbers of young RBCs, showing a regenerative response. Biochemistry and urinalysis : These tests will look at organ function and other parameters that may be causing the anemia. Slide agglutination test : This simple blood test looks for abnormal clumping of RBCs in IMHA. Cytology or blood smear : This test evaluates RBCs under a microscope and may help find the cause and the bone marrow’s response. Bone marrow evaluation : This test can help look for causes of anemia by examining the bone marrow for cancer, signs of regeneration, or infectious agents. Imaging : Radiographs and ultrasound may help look for underlying causes of anemia, such as bleeding tumors. Other tests : Serology for infectious agents, fecal tests, coagulation profiles, endocrine testing, organ function tests, and biopsy of tumors are all other possible tests for dogs with anemia. Treatment of Anemia in Dogs The primary goal for dogs with anemia is to treat the underlying condition. Treatment varies based on chronicity and severity of the disease. Some common treatment methods for anemia include: Surgery to remove bleeding masses or repair traumatic wounds Vitamin K therapy to treat rodenticide poisoning Antiparasitic drugs to treat internal parasites Antibiotics to treat tick-borne or other infectious agents Discontinuing offending drugs Steroids or immunosuppressing medications to treat autoimmune diseases Blood products to provide RBCs and other important blood cells Supportive care, including intravenous fluids Recovery and Management of Anemia in Dogs Most veterinarians use serial complete blood count and/or PCV/TS testing to watch the dog’s response to treatment, in addition to watching any other diseases potentially causing the anemia. In general, if the underlying disease is treated, anemia may take multiple weeks for the dog to return to normal, but clinical improvement is usually noted within a few days. These dogs may require life-long medical management and monitoring for recurrence. Some causes of anemia such as trauma, infectious agents, or parasites, may be cured. However, severe cases of anemia may be too progressed to treat, even with aggressive therapy. Management varies based on the predisposing factor and may be lifelong. Dogs with IMHA are at risk for flare-ups. Care should be taken whenever administering medications or vaccines in those dogs to decrease the risk of a recurrence.

    "content": "Much like human children, puppies can have orthopedic (bone and joint) abnormalities that affect their overall growth and development. If you’re noticing a bend or twist in one or more of your young dog’s legs, you might be looking at an angular limb deformity. Learn about the causes of angular limb deformities in dogs, treatment for the condition, and what you can do to prevent angular limb deformities in your pup. Key Takeaways An angular limb deformity is abnormal limb growth and development that occurs when a growth plate on a bone closes too early or grows too quickly. Veterinarians can usually diagnose an angular limb deformity with a physical examination. Surgery is recommended to fix angular limb deformities that cause symptoms. What Are Angular Limb Deformities in Dogs? An angular limb deformity is abnormal limb growth and development that happens when a growth plate on a bone closes too early or grows too quickly. When a growth plate on one bone closes too early, the paired bone continues to grow. This can cause the limb to bend or twist in an abnormal direction at the joints. For example, there are two bones in a dog’s forearm—the radius and ulna. If the growth plate at the bottom of the ulna stops growing and the radius continues growing, the radius will twist and bend as it grows. Its ability to grow in a straight line is impaired by the restricted length of the ulna. An angular limb deformity is not an emergency, but you should contact your veterinarian if you are concerned that your dog’s limbs are not developing normally. However, if your puppy has a broken limb , they should get urgent care to have the best chance of avoiding abnormal limb development. Types of Angular Limb Deformities in Dogs The most common types of angular limb deformities in dogs are carpal valgus and carpal varus, which affect the wrist(s) of the front leg(s). Angular limb deformities are more common in dogs’ front legs. Carpal valgus: With this condition, the paws are turned outward. Carpal varus: With this condition, the elbows are often bowed out, and the paws are turned inward. In truth, the overall classification of angular limb deformities can be quite complicated, depending on various factors such as the number of growth plates affected, the degree of twist, the angulation of the limbs, and the specific bones involved. Veterinary specialists are still developing classification systems to define angular limb deformities. Symptoms of Angular Limb Deformities in Dogs The most common symptoms of angular limb deformities in dogs include: Visible twisting or turning of a limb Bowlegged appearance Lameness or limping in the affected limb Pain when the affected joints are touched Causes of Angular Limb Deformities in Dogs Trauma to a growth plate can cause it to close early. This can happen because of a fracture through the growth plate or a crush injury to the growth plate (such as being stepped on). Premature closure of a growth plate is the most common cause of angular limb deformity in dogs. Puppies can also get angular limb deformities if they have a developmental disorder, such as hypertrophic osteodystrophy (HOD) . Some of these conditions have a genetic aspect, while others may be caused by nutritional problems. Large-breed puppies who are not fed a diet that’s right for a growing large-breed dog are also at risk of angular limb deformities. How Veterinarians Diagnose Angular Limb Deformities in Dogs Veterinarians can usually diagnose an angular limb deformity with a physical examination . Vets are likely to request X-rays to more fully understand the cause and severity of the angulation, as well as look at secondary side effects. For example, with premature closure of a growth plate at the bottom of the ulna in the front leg, the radius can push up on the humerus (the upper-arm bone), causing subluxation (partial dislocation) of the elbow. For complicated cases or cases that need surgery, you will likely be referred to a board-certified veterinary surgeon for advanced diagnostics and treatment. To fully understand the abnormality, some specialists may request a CT scan . Pet parents don’t generally need to do much to prepare for their first consult. If your veterinarian plans to sedate your dog for imaging, they might ask that you don’t feed your dog the day of your appointment. Make sure to let your veterinarian know: What you feed your dog If your dog had an injury in the last few months, such as falling, getting stepped on, or being hit by a car Any signs that you’ve noticed, such as limping Treatment of Angular Limb Deformities in Dogs Mild abnormalities might not seem to affect your dog’s quality of life. For these cases, treatment might not be recommended. Surgery is recommended to fix angular limb deformities that cause symptoms. These surgeries are usually done by a board-certified veterinary surgeon, and the specific surgery used will depend on your dog’s specific angular limb deformity. For growing puppies with premature closure of the lower ulnar growth plate, the most common procedure is called an ulnar ostectomy, in which a cut is made through the ulna to release tension on the elbow and wrist. For some angular limb deformities, portions of bone are removed. If you choose medical management for your dog, you should expect your dog to get arthritis in the affected limb as they age. Medical management may include anti-inflammatory pain medications, such as carprofen or grapiprant . You may also consider joint supplements, such as Dasuquin .

Angular Limb Deformities in Dogs FAQs Can a dog live with angular limb deformity? Yes, dogs can live with an angular limb deformity. However, some angular limb deformities cause significant pain, affecting your dog’s quality of life. What causes angular deformity? Angular limb deformities are usually caused by issues affecting the growth plate of a growing puppy, such as an injury, a developmental condition, or nutritional shortages. What is angular deformity of the dog’s forelimb? An angular limb deformity of the dog’s forelimb is usually caused by early closure of a growth plate in the ulna or radius, the long bones in the lower part of the dog’s front leg. Is angular limb deformity genetic? Genetics can play a role in angular limb deformities, but there can be many factors that lead to the condition.

Why Do Dogs Have Different-Sized Pupils in Anisocoria? When a disease or trauma disrupts the nerves or muscles controlling pupil size, one pupil can become abnormally dilated or constricted. While lighting plays a role in changing pupil sizes, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are also involved. The sympathetic nervous system is often referred to as “fight or flight.” It’s the segment of the animal’s nervous system that gets triggered when faced with danger or intense physical activity. When the sympathetic nervous system is activated, the pupils dilate to allow more light into the retinas, enhancing vision. This is why frightened dogs often have dilated pupils. On the other hand, the parasympathetic nervous system is nicknamed the “rest and digest” response. It gets activated during periods of relaxation. When a dog is eating or resting, the parasympathetic nervous system comes into play, causing the pupils to become smaller. The mechanisms engaged in changing pupil size entail the collaboration of multiple elements: nerves, muscles, the brain, and the retina. If any of the processes in this pathway are disrupted, abnormalities can occur. These abnormalities might manifest on the eye’s surface, within the iris muscles, along the nerves connected to the eye, within the retina, or even within the brain itself.

There are several clinical signs that can occur with anisocoria in dogs, depending on the underlying cause. In addition to asymmetrical pupil sizes, one or many of the following may be noticed: Redness of the conjunctiva, the white part of the eyeball Squinting Drainage from the eye Eye discoloration Drooping of the eyelid or face Head shaking Elevated third eyelid Lethargy or reduced activity level Causes of Anisocoria in Dogs Several conditions lead to anisocoria in dogs. While some of these conditions are chronic and relatively benign, others are more serious: Iris atrophy: This condition involves changes to the iris, the colored part of the dog’s eye. This is more common in senior dogs of small breeds, such as the Chihuahua , Miniature Poodle , and Miniature Schnauzer . Injury to the cornea: The cornea, the eye’s clear surface, can suffer injuries, often in the form of scratches called corneal ulcers. These ulcers can be very painful, resulting in a reduced pupil size in the affected eye. Head trauma: Incidents like being hit by a car, kicked by a large farm animal, or experiencing a fall can cause increased intracranial pressure if the brain is bruised or bleeding. This pressure can subsequently result in anisocoria as it compresses the nerves that enter the eyes. Glaucoma: Glaucoma is an abnormal increase of pressure inside the eye. It’s a genetic condition that can lead to optic nerve damage, anisocoria, and even blindness. Cancer: Several cancers can cause uneven pupil sizes. Meningiomas, one of the most common types of brain tumor in dogs, can disrupt the eye’s nerve function, causing changes in pupil size. Also, a tumor developing within the eye can lead to anisocoria. Horner’s syndrome: This syndrome results in one-sided facial drooping, an elevated third eyelid, and a constricted pupil. It is the result of damage to the sympathetic nervous system, either by disease or injury. Middle ear infection: When an ear infection becomes deep, inflammation can impact surrounding nerves, leading to a small pupil on the affected side. Uveitis: Uveitis is the inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. This inflammation can lead to a range of symptoms and complications, including constriction of the pupil, cloudiness in the eye, squinting, and redness.  Various conditions, including  infections and immune-mediated diseases, can cause uveitis. Other trauma: Sometimes less obvious forms of trauma, such as the use of choke collars or deep ear flushing, can accidentally cause damage to nerves involved in pupillary constriction, causing changes in pupil size. How Veterinarians Diagnose Anisocoria in Dogs Anisocoria is diagnosed through an ophthalmic examination. Your veterinarian will use an instrument called an ophthalmoscope to examine the interior of your dog’s eyes. They will likely shine a bright light into each eye to evaluate the normal pupillary light response, to determine which pupil is normal and which is abnormal, and to see how well they constrict and dilate. They will do a full physical exam before deciding if more tests are necessary. Your veterinarian will likely also perform several tests on your dog’s eyes. They may stain the cornea with fluorescein dye to detect ulcers, assess the pressure of the eyes, and check tear production. Depending on what they suspect the underlying cause to be, they may recommend blood work or imaging, especially if an underlying systemic disease is suspected. Treatment of Anisocoria in Dogs The treatment approach depends on the underlying cause and can vary greatly, ranging from no recommended treatment to surgery. Many conditions that can lead to anisocoria, such as corneal injuries or damage to sympathetic nerves, can be effectively treated. Some conditions, like uveitis and glaucoma, can only be managed long-term, but anisocoria may resolve with appropriate management of the underlying disease. Other conditions may be untreatable, such as iris atrophy or specific cancers. For iris atrophy, no treatment is necessary, as this is considered a benign change. This contrasts with a brain tumor, where treatment may not be feasible if a decrease in quality of life is likely. Your veterinarian will discuss recommended treatment options after establishing a diagnosis. Anisocoria is a sign of an underlying condition, not a disease itself. Therefore, the focus is not on treating anisocoria, but rather on addressing the problem that led to the difference in pupil size. Recovery and Management of Anisocoria in Dogs Expectations for recovery are dependent on the underlying cause of anisocoria. If it’s due to iris atrophy in a small-breed senior dog, the prognosis for a normal life is excellent. In cases of an injury affecting nerves or the eye resulting in anisocoria, recovery from the injury should lead to resolution of anisocoria. Some dogs may require lifelong treatment, such as eye drops, if an underlying eye condition is diagnosed. For instance, glaucoma requires consistent use of eye drops and regular veterinary check-ups to monitor eye pressure for the remainder of a dog’s life. If your dog loses vision because of their condition, the vision loss is usually permanent. While this is not a common outcome for most underlying causes of anisocoria, it can occur if conditions are left untreated for too long. For this reason, it’s important to consult with your veterinarian right away if you see your dog’s pupils aredifferent sizes. Anisocoria in Dogs FAQS What is temporary anisocoria in dogs? Temporary anisocoria is when a dog’s pupils are different sizes for a short duration of time and then return to normal. This can happen if there is inflammation inside the eye or inflammation affecting the nerves involved in changing pupil size. If this inflammation subsides quickly and pupils return to their normal size, it is categorized as temporary anisocoria. Can anisocoria in dogs go away on its own? Anisocoria can occasionally resolve on its own; however, it’s important to consult with a veterinarian right away to rule out more serious underlying causes, such as trauma. Why are my dog’s pupils different sizes? The term for different-sized pupils in dogs is anisocoria. This condition can stem from various underlying factors, ranging from minor issues to potentially life-threatening ones. If your dog’s pupils are different sizes, it means that either inflammation, compression, or injury has occurred affecting the eye, the nerves connected to the eye, or even the brain.

Formation is also encouraged by \tantibiotic  treatment of the host, resistance of the host, \tsuitability of the site  for establishment of the infective \tbacterium, and relatively low to  moderate virulence of the infecting \tbacterium. Diagnosis L-form bacteria are difficult organisms to isolate and identify. Using a  process of differential diagnosis, which is guided by deeper inspection  of the apparent outward symptoms, ruling out each of the more common  causes until the correct disorder is settled upon and can be treated  appropriately, the veterinarian will make a diagnosis by putting all of  the signs and symptoms together, along with any consistent laboratory  results, to come to a conclusion. Your doctor will also collect some of  the fluid from any draining  lesions, as well as joint fluid fr analysis. Treatment Gentle cleaning of the wound will help to degrade the fragile L-form organisms. In most cases, doctors allow the open wounds to heal by secondary intention; that is, the open edges of the wound are not intentionally closed (e.g., by stitches), but are allowed to heal by themselves, growing new tissue over the wound. The main treatment in this case is by cleansing the wound, applying antibiotic ointment to the wound, and applying fresh bandages. Your veterinarian will prescribe medications such as antibiotics to treat the symptoms as well as the disease; however, these organisms are resistant and difficult to target with antibiotics. The fever usually breaks within 24-48 hours. In many cases, arthritic symptoms continue to persist.",

Diagnosis is made by the historical findings, such as exposure to cold, the results of the physical examination, and demonstrating cold agglutination (adhesion of red blood cells) in vitro. Skin lesions typically present as inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin (erythema), acrocyanosis, and ulceration of the tips of the ears and tail, nose and feet. Other associated conditions to rule out include hepatocutaneous syndrome(skin disease caused caused by liver disease); erythema multiforme (reaction to infection or medication); toxic epidermic necrolysis (blistering and peeling); dermatomyositis (skin rash caused by a muscle disease), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)  – bleeding into the skin; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); lymphoreticular neoplasms (cancer caused by proliferation of red cells in the lymphs); frostbite; lead poisoning; and pemphigus (an autoimmune disease). A diagnosis of anemia should be demonstrated by blood tests to help distinguish warm antibody hemolytic anemia (autoimmune disease) from other causes of red blood cell destruction/loss. Macroscopic hemagglutination (clumping of red blood cells) in vitro may lead to rouleaux formation (stacks of red blood cells, as with coin rolls); mimicking erythrocyte agglutination (red blood cell clumping) on a glass slide. Treatment Your dog will need to be hospitalized in a warm environment until its health has stabilized and the disease is nonprogressive. Supportive care and wound management depend on clinical signs. If necrosis involving the tail tip or feet is severe, amputation may be required. Removal of the spleen is of little assistance in patients with IgM-mediated hemolytic disorders, but may be helpful in those with therapy-resistant IgG-mediated hemolytic anemia. Living and Management Animals that have suffered from this condition are prone to relapse. Keep your dog in a warm environment at all times to prevent relapse. Prognosis is guarded to fair and recovery may take weeks.",

If you suspect that your dog has come into contact with rat or mouse poison, and you are seeing some of the symptoms listed above, you will need to bring your dog to a veterinarian before your pet's health becomes critical. Keep in mind that outdoor dogs (or dogs that go outside frequently) are at risk of rodent poisoning. It might be in a neighbor's yard, in a trash bag, or in an alleyway. Dogs that engage in chasing and killing rodents may also be susceptible to this type of poisoning. Even if you do not live in an area where rats or mice are a concern, rodent poison may be used for other common suburban pests like raccoons, opossums, or squirrels. Some of the main anticoagulant chemicals that can be found in rodent poisons (or other household products) are: Warfarin Hydroxycoumadin Brodifacoum Bromadiolone Pindone Diphacinone Diphenadione Chlorohacinone The first kind of anticoagulants are cumulative poisons. These poisons contain warfarin and hydroxycoumadin as main anticoagulants and they require multiple feedings that take several days to kill a rodent. The second type of anticoagulant is deadlier, killing rodents in a single serving dose rather than over time. These deadlier anticoagulant poisons contain indanedione class products, like pindone, diphacinone, diphenadione and chlorohacinone, all of which are extremely toxic. Rodenticides that contain the ingredients bromadiolone and brodifacoum, for example, are 50 to 200 times more poisonous than the kind that contain warfarin and hydroxycoumadin. Another cause of anticoagulant poisoning in dogs is the accidental ingestion of medication. Heparin, a common drug for treating blood clotting in humans, can have a toxic effect on animals. Often, dogs that have access to medications will eat what they have found, either because the drugs are within reach, or because the drug cabinet is kept unlocked. Diagnosis Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam on your dog, taking into account the background history of symptoms and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health and recent activities. A complete blood profile will be conducted, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. In addition, your doctor will check the time it takes the dog's blood to clot to determine to severity of the poisoning. If you have a sample of the poison, you will need to take that with you to the veterinarian's office; bringing samples of the dog's vomit and/or stool may also be helpful. Treatment If your dog is suffering from spontaneous bleeding caused by anticoagulants, the treatment will involve administering fresh whole blood, or frozen plasma, in an amount determined by the rate and volume of the animal's blood loss. Vitamin K, which is necessary for normal blood clotting, will be used specifically as an antidote, and will be given by subcutaneous (under the skin) injections, with repeated doses as necessary -- by injection or even orally -- until the blood clotting time returns to normal. Do not induce vomiting unless you have been advised to do so by your veterinarian. Some poisons can cause more harm coming back through the esophagus than they did going down. Living and Management If your dog consumes a mild cumulative form of an anticoagulant, your dog may recover in a week, but if it was the lethal single dose anticoagulant, it may take up to a month. Prevention Anticoagulant poisoning can be prevented by keeping all poisons out of the reach of your pets. All other chemicals, drugs, and medications (especially blood thinning drugs) should also be kept out of your dog's reach -- ideally inside of a cabinet.",

    "content": "Lilies aren’t just dangerous to cats—they pose a risk to dogs, too. While lethal lily poisonings are rare in dogs, lilies are still considered to be poisonous to our canine companions. You should be aware of lily toxicity in dogs so you can help keep your pets protected. Here’s everything you need to know about lily poisoning in dogs, including the types of toxic lilies, signs of lily toxicity and treatment methods. Which Types of Lilies Are Poisonous to Dogs? Steer clear of lilies in general when choosing plants for your garden or indoor décor. While not all types of lilies are highly toxic to dogs, the majority of lilies can cause an upset tummy or other uncomfortable reactions. Lilies That Are Toxic for Dogs Prairie Lily (Rain Lily) : These types of lilies can be poisonous to dogs. The bulbs of these lilies are the most poisonous part of the plant and can cause mild to severe gastrointestinal (GI) upset in dogs. Lily of the Valley : This plant contains cardio glycosides, which are gastrointestinal irritants. If a dog eats the leaves, flower or root of this lily, it can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, slowed heart rate, severe heart arrhythmias, seizures and, in severe cases, even death. Peace Lily : The peace lily plant contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals, which are absorbed into the skin tissue and cause mouth and GI tract irritation. If a dog chews on any part of this plant, the crystals can cause intense burning and irritation of the mouth, tongue and lips. It can also cause excessive drooling, vomiting and difficulty swallowing. Calla Lily : Similar to the peace lily, the calla lily also contains insoluble calcium oxalate crystals. Even just a nibble of this plant can lead to exposure to the crystals and adverse symptoms. The crystals can cause oral irritation, excessive drooling, difficulty swallowing, vomiting and a decreased appetite. If you suspect that your dog has ingested or chewed on any of these types of lilies, take them to your veterinarian. Nontoxic Types of Lilies The Peruvian lily, tiger lily, daylily and Easter lily are all classified as nontoxic to dogs. While these types of lilies may be classified as nontoxic, they can still cause unpleasant reactions in a dog. The introduction of any new, novel foods into any pet’s diet can cause GI upset. At the end of the day, it is best to keep any plants in your home out of reach of your pets.

If you are not sure which lily your dog ingested, the most common symptoms to look for include: Vomiting Diarrhea Decreased appetite Excessive drooling Pawing at the face due to oral irritation (limited to calla lilies and peace lilies) Heart problems are possible with ingestion of lily of the valley Symptoms will often start within two hours of ingestion, so if you start to notice your pup displaying these signs, it is time to call your veterinarian. Treatment Treatment will depend upon how long ago the ingestion occurred, what type of lily it was and your dog’s clinical signs. If you are certain the ingestion occurred within an hour and you can’t get to the vet quickly, your veterinarian may recommend that you induce vomiting with hydrogen peroxide to help remove the irritants. Call your veterinarian prior to inducing vomiting, and let them prescribe the correct and safe dose. If you can get your dog to veterinarian quickly, the vet can safely administer hydrogen peroxide or apomorphine. Apomorphine works like an eye drop and induces vomiting in dogs. If it has been over an hour since ingestion, a veterinarian may administer activated charcoal to help absorb the toxins and remove them from the body. Blood work will likely need to be evaluated to watch for any organ toxicity. Additional medications to protect the GI tract and organs may be administered, along with IV fluids to dilute the poison that may have been absorbed. Ingesting most lilies won’t necessitate hospitalization for dogs; however, lily of the valley is the most likely exception. In these cases, hospitalization for a day or two may be recommended.

    "content": "Arrhythmia in dogs refers to an abnormal heart rhythm. There are various types of arrhythmias, ranging in severity from benign (harmless) to life-threatening. Key Takeaways Dogs can develop arrhythmias for several reasons, but they are caused by abnormal electrical impulses within the heart that affect the heart’s normal function. Many dog breeds, including Boxers, German Shepherds, West Highland White Terriers, and Great Danes, are predisposed to heart arrhythmias. Some arrhythmias are curable with appropriate treatment while others must be managed long-term. What Is an Arrhythmia in Dogs? Depending on their severity, arrhythmias in dogs can cause physical symptoms such as difficulty breathing , exercise intolerance , and weakness . Dogs can develop arrhythmias for several reasons, but they are caused by abnormal electrical impulses within the heart that affect the heart’s normal function. Arrhythmias can cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or irregularly. Some arrhythmias can be mild and don’t interfere with normal functioning, while others can be life-threatening. However, only a veterinarian can differentiate these. If you think your dog may have a heart issue, it’s important to see your veterinarian immediately. Types of Arrhythmias in Dogs There are numerous types of arrhythmias in dogs. Five of the most common are: Sinus arrhythmia: This arrhythmia results from abnormal heart impulses that correspond to breathing, or respiration. When a dog with a sinus arrhythmia breathes in, their heart rate increases. When they breathe out, their heart rate decreases. Sinus arrhythmia is very common in dogs and rarely a cause for concern. Boxer cardiomyopathy: This genetic heart condition results in arrhythmias due to problems with a dog’s heart muscle. The condition frequently leads to collapse and sometimes death. Atrial fibrillation: This serious arrhythmia occurs when the top part of the heart flutters instead of effectively pumping blood. This leads to poor blood output to the body. Ventricular premature complexes (VPCs): When a heartbeat begins in the lower part of the heart instead of the top, it is referred to as a VPC. Their significance varies depending on how often and when they are present. Atrioventricular (AV) block: An AV block occurs when electrical impulses in the heart fail to spread throughout all the chambers. As a result, blood output to the body is inadequate. These arrhythmias can range in severity from mild to life-threatening. Symptoms of an Arrhythmia in Dogs Symptoms of arrhythmias in dogs can include: Irregular heartbeat Exercise intolerance Panting Coughing Swollen abdomen Weakness Lethargy Cold extremities Discolored (bluish) extremities Weak pulse Difficulty breathing Pale gums Decreased appetite Sudden collapse Death Causes of an Arrhythmia in Dogs Many dog breeds, including Boxers , German Shepherds , West Highland White Terriers , and Great Danes , are predisposed to heart arrhythmias. Dogs of all ages can be affected. When dogs are diagnosed with arrhythmias, it’s usually due to one of the following: Genetics: Many dog breeds are predisposed to developing arrhythmias simply because of their genes. Some dogs develop these heart conditions later in life while others are born with them (congenital). Infection: If a dog develops an infection involving their heart , the muscle can be affected and interfere with normal heart function. Heartworm disease: If a dog contracts heartworm disease , the adult worms can prevent normal blood flow and prevent the heart muscle from contracting efficiently. Toxin: Toxic substances a dog may accidentally ingest have the potential to lead to irregular heart rhythms. Trauma: Blunt force trauma, such as from falling, can damage the heart and lead to arrhythmias. Vagal response: Anything that affects the vagus nerve (a major nerve that controls heart rate), including respiration and underlying disease, can lead to arrhythmias. Anemia: If a dog’s red blood cell count is low , it can lead to arrhythmia due to the lack of oxygen-rich blood needed to properly supply the body. Chronic health condition: Some medical conditions, such as hypothyroidism , can increase the likelihood of arrhythmias. How Veterinarians Diagnose an Arrhythmia in Dogs To diagnose arrhythmias in dogs, a veterinarian begins with a complete physical exam , paying special attention to the dog’s heart, lungs, and pulse. The gums are also checked for color and capillary refill time, assessed by gently pressing on the gums and counting how many seconds it takes for color to return. During this time, pet parents should let their veterinarian know if they have seen any abnormal symptoms at home, such as fainting, weakness, or difficulty breathing. If a veterinarian hears an abnormal heart rhythm with their stethoscope, additional testing can be done. This may include: Blood work: A small blood sample is collected and tested for infection, heartworm disease, anemia, and other issues. Electrocardiogram (EKG): Leads are placed on a dog in specific locations to measure their heart rhythm and rate. Echocardiogram: A dog may be referred to a veterinary cardiologist for a non-invasive test using ultrasound to evaluate how the heart beats in real time. This can help determine where the arrhythmia originates within the heart. Holter monitor: This non-invasive test identifies abnormalities in a dog’s heart rate and rhythm over a longer period. Dogs wear a vest-like monitor for 24 hours so their veterinarian can identify abnormalities during rest and activity. X-rays: X-rays of the chest and abdomen help the veterinarian identify areas of heart enlargement or signs of heart failure, such as fluid in the lungs or abdomen. Treatment of an Arrhythmia in Dogs Treatment for arrhythmias in dogs depends on the underlying cause. Some arrhythmias are curable with appropriate treatment while others must be managed long-term. Treatment options for arrhythmias may include: Medications: The veterinarian may prescribe medications, such as diltiazem or amlodipine , to restore normal heart rate and rhythm. Antibiotics: If the dog has an infection, antibiotics may be prescribed to eliminate it and restore the heart rate to normal. Antibiotics may include amoxicillin or enrofloxacin . Immiticide: If a dog has been diagnosed with heartworm disease, their veterinarian may administer this injectable medication to eliminate the parasite. Supportive care: If a dog has ingested something toxic, their veterinarian will provide supportive care such as fluid therapy and appropriate medications, which may include an antidote or activated charcoal , to counteract the toxin. Blood transfusion: If severe anemia is causing an arrhythmia, a blood transfusion may be recommended to restore the red blood cell count. Pacemaker: Some dogs may require a pacemaker, implanted by a veterinary cardiologist, to regulate their heart rhythm.

However, if an underlying medical condition is causing the arrhythmia, such as anemia or heartworm disease, most dogs fully recover once that condition is appropriately treated. For example, treated dogs can recover from anemia within a few days, while dogs with heartworm disease typically recover in a few months. However, lasting heart damage may be present in some cases, requiring long-term medication to control the heart rate. Prevention of an Arrhythmia in Dogs Pet parents can ensure their dogs receive regular veterinary preventive care so that any heart concerns or underlying health issues that may lead to arrhythmias in dogs are caught early. Keeping dogs on monthly heartworm prevention reduces the risk of contracting heartworm disease, which increases their likelihood of arrhythmias.

Arrhythmia in Dogs FAQs How do you treat arrhythmias in dogs? Arrhythmias in dogs are treated with antiarrhythmic medications. If the arrhythmia was due to an underlying cause, the veterinarian can prescribe a suitable treatment plan to address the condition. How long do dogs with heart arrhythmias live? Dogs with mild arrhythmias can live normal lives with appropriate monitoring, while dogs with severe arrhythmias generally develop heart failure and may succumb to the disease within months. Is an irregular heartbeat serious in dogs? Irregular heartbeats in dogs can be serious or benign. For example, sinus arrhythmias that develop due to changes in respiration are benign, while atrial fibrillation is a serious health concern.

You will need to give a thorough history of your dog's health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have precipitated this condition. A history of any medications given to your dog lately will also help in diagnosis. Frequently, owners will bring their dogs to the veterinarian with the complaint of a sudden unexplained episode of vomiting. However, few owners report seeing their dogs ingest arsenic-containing compounds so this may not be the first cause that apparent. Your veterinarian will perform a complete blood profile, including a chemical blood profile, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. A sample of the stomach contents may also be necessary. Arsenic in the blood stream or stomach contents will confirm the diagnosis. In cases of chronic arsenic poisoning the level of arsenic in the body can be evaluated from a hair sample, as arsenic is deposited in the hair over a course of time. If possible, you should collect a sample of the vomit or diarrhea to take to the veterinarian. This will help to speed the diagnostic process so that your dog can be treated before further damage is done. Treatment Acute (sudden) arsenic poisoning is an emergency and time remains the crucial factor for a successful outcome. Vomiting plays a protective role in arsenic poisoning as it expels a large portion of the ingested poisonous material. However, if vomiting is not initiated in the immediate aftermath, your veterinarian will need to perform a gastric lavage (stomach irrigation) to wash out the stomach contents. As arsenic severely damages the liver and kidneys, dialysis is conducted for dogs that are in a state of kidney failure due to arsenic poisoning. The main objective of treatment is to flush the poison out of the body; therefore fluid therapy and drugs promoting excretion are commonly employed. Also, some compounds are known to chelate (bind) heavy metals such as arsenic, and are commonly used to bind arsenic that is still present in the body. Chelators work both by slowing the arsenic down before it can cross the blood-brain barrier, and by making it more water-soluble so that it can be washed from the body more effectively. Your veterinarian can employ such antidotes to enhance recovery in your dog. Your dog may need to be admitted into the veterinary hospital for a few days until it has stabilized and is completely out of danger. Conversely, if you actually witnessed your dog consuming the poison, you  can act quickly by inducing vomiting, but this must be done immediately  following the event. Call your doctor for instructions on how to induce  vomiting safely. If time elapses from the time of ingestion, only a  veterinarian can treat your dog. Because induced vomiting can be  dangerous with some toxins, as some poisons will do more harm coming  back through the esophagus than they did going down, do not induce  vomiting unless you are absolutely sure of what your dog has ingested.  If your dog has already vomited, do not try to force more vomiting. A final word, do not induce vomiting if your dog is unconscious, is having trouble breathing, or is exhibiting signs of serious distress or shock. Whether your dog vomits or not, after the initial care, you must take it to a veterinary facility immediately. Living and Management After returning from the hospital, allow your dog proper rest and protect it from any source of stress. Follow your veterinarian’s guidelines for home treatment, such as medication and nutrition. Easily digestible food is often recommended for dogs that are recovering from a poisoning. Ensure that all sources of arsenic-compounds are secured or removed. If they must be kept in the home, be sure that they are out of reach of children and pets. Most problems are easily avoided if guidelines for handling and keeping such poisonous compounds are followed. Keep an eye on your dog and if you observe anything unusual in its behavior, immediately consult your veterinarian. Unfortunately, in many cases of heavy intoxication, very few patients survive unless treatment is started very early.",

Symptoms and Types Neck pain Stiff neck Lowered head Hunched back Grunting when lifted Muscle spasms (especially in front legs and neck) Shaking Fever Lack of appetite Lethargy Unwillingness to move For a beagle puppy that is suffering from this condition, opening the jaw will seem to be painful, and the puppy will be reluctant to bark. The symptoms usually will become apparent when the puppy is four to ten months of age, but the condition can manifest at an older age as well. It may resolve itself without treatment, but even if it does, it will typically return within a few months.

Medical researchers also suspect a related auto-immune factor. Diagnosis Bacterial meningitis, inflammation of a vertebral disc, spinal tumor, and cervical disc disease should be ruled out before confirming a diagnosis of juvenile polyarteritis. X-rays tend not to show evidence of disease if necrotizing vasculitis is present. A spinal tap is usually better for determining the nature of the disease. While this is a form of meningitis, its source is not bacterial, so antibacterial medications will not resolve the condition. Your veterinarian will need to conduct a full blood work-up for further confirmation, and the lab results may show anemia (low red blood cells), a high white blood cell count indicating infection, or other blood abnormalities. There will usually be an attendant fever, also an indication of infection. Treatment Prednisone, an anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive medication similar to cortisone, is the usual treatment of choice. Patients tend to show rapid improvement in just a few days, but even so, relapses often occur when the medication is discontinued. Continuing treatment for a longer period of time, like six months, will sometimes result in permanent resolution. At the outset of therapy, steroid treatment should be administered at a level that will produce a remission of the symptoms, and then your veterinarian can recommend a regimen of oral therapy. Over the course of treatment, the amount will be reduced slowly to the lowest possible dose needed to control symptoms. If symptoms return, steroid treatment will need to begin again. Living and Management One of the side effects of steroid treatment is fluid retention and increased thirst. To prevent accidents or discomfort on your dog's behalf, you will need to take your dog out frequently for urination, even if only for a small amount. A calm, quiet environment, where your pet will not be stimulated, is important. Moving will be painful during the recovery process, and it will benefit your dog if you give it an isolated space, away from children or animals, at least until the symptoms have subsided. Even after recovery, you will need to be alert to the possibility that your dog may have a relapse.",

With larger amounts of fluid and more serious underlying causes, the symptoms can become more severe. Some include: Lethargy Decreased appetite or anorexia Vomiting or retching Diarrhea , increased or decreased frequency of bowel movements Weakness Distended abdomen Weight gain Restlessness Excessive panting Increased thirst, increased urination Pain upon palpation of the abdomen Vocalizing when laying down Pale , blue, or purple gums Fainting ( syncope ) Coughing Rapid, shallow breathing Difficulty breathing (dyspnea) Causes of Ascites in Dogs Since ascites is an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, it causes bloating. This secondary condition indicates a more serious primary cause, which should be examined by your veterinarian as soon as possible. Common primary conditions that cause ascites in dogs are: Heart disease: right-sided heart disease (most common cause of free fluid in the abdomen of dogs), right-sided congestive heart failure , heartworm disease , dilated cardiomyopathy , and pulmonic stenosis . Liver: chronic liver failure and hepatitis; portal hypertension Proteins : low protein concentrations (decreased albumin); protein losing enteropathy (gastrointestinal protein loss) and protein losing nephropathy (kidney disease); nephrotic syndrome (kidney disease). Trauma to a dog’s body: can cause organs to burst, leaking fluid into the abdomen; urine leaking from the bladder or urinary system causes a uroabdomen ; and damage to the liver or spleen causes free-floating blood in the abdomen. Peritonitis : this is an infection in the lining of the abdominal wall that can lead to free-floating fluid in the abdomen. Poison: rat poison ingestion can cause a dog’s blood to clot improperly. This is another cause of free-floating blood in the abdomen. Cancer : It causes free-floating fluid in the abdomen for a variety of reasons, from a ruptured organ, pressure on major blood vessels, or inflammation due to a tumor—all of which can cause blood or other bodily fluids to cause ascites. How Veterinarians Diagnose Ascites in Dogs If your dog has any abdominal enlargement or is showing signs associated with free-floating fluid in the abdomen, they should be examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible. Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination of your dog. Ascites may be detectable on palpation (the process of feeling or touching) of the abdomen or with an abdominal ultrasound or x-rays. The type of fluid in the abdomen depends on the underlying cause. If your dog is stable and not in any distress, your vet can take a sample of the fluid with a small needle passed through the abdominal wall. They will then look at the fluid under a microscope and try to determine what kind of fluid is present. This will help them target the possible primary medical condition causing the free-floating fluid in the abdomen. It is also important to run baseline lab work such as a complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, and urinalysis to evaluate your dog and help determine the underlying cause of the ascites Treatment of Ascites in Dogs Once your veterinarian has diagnosed your dog’s condition, often the first step in the treatment plan is to remove the fluid. This is not often a cure, as the fluid will likely build back up again, but it can help establish the cause of the ascites. The treatment plan will remove the abnormal fluid and also address the underlying medical condition. Sometimes a surgical procedure is necessary to treat the primary cause, such as a tumor or damaged organs. Not all causes of free-floating fluid in the abdomen require surgery, but almost all dogs with ascites do need to be hospitalized while being treated. Intravenous (IV) medications such as the diuretics furosemide and spironolactone are often given to help absorb some of the fluid. Diuretics are often most helpful when right-sided heart disease or heart failure is the cause of the ascites. With anemia and low protein levels, a blood or plasma transfusion is often necessary. Medications to help with liver and kidney dysfunction are also important, if necessary. Your dog might require a special diet for the rest of their life, such as with protein loss from a gastrointestinal condition or right-sided heart disease. Recovery and Management of Ascites in Dogs Given the wide range of probable causes of ascites, a prognosis can only be made once an underlying diagnosis is determined. Surgery may be needed to manage some of the emergency causes of abdominal fluid. In other cases, the condition may be managed with medication. There are some conditions that cause ascites that are manageable or even curable. Unfortunately, some conditions may not be treatable. Although ascites is not always caused by a life-threatening condition, it can often indicate a very poor outcome, especially in older dogs and those that may be diagnosed with cancer. If your dog has a distended abdomen it should never be ignored, as it may be a sign of a serious disease. It is also crucial that you follow your veterinarian’s advice for a possible quick recovery.

    "content": "What Is Aspiration Pneumonia in Dogs? Aspiration pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs caused by an inhaled material such as food, regurgitation, or vomit. This condition usually happens when there is an underlying problem with the normal reflexes of swallowing and pushing material down the esophagus. In aspiration pneumonia, food makes its way into the airways and is inhaled into the lungs. Normal Anatomy vs. Abnormal Anatomy In a normal anatomic structure, once food is chewed and mixed with saliva (food bolus), it is ready to be swallowed. The food bolus is then pushed by the tongue to the throat (pharynx). This space, called the pharynx, meets the end of the nasal cavity (nasopharynx), and is separated by a thin membrane of tissue called the soft palate. The larynx is the opening into the trachea. The pharynx and larynx are separated by a piece of cartilage called the epiglottis. The epiglottis is part of the structures known as the voice box. The tongue is a large muscle that extends down the throat and attaches to other muscles and cartilage around the epiglottis. The tongue, soft palate, and epiglottis work together to close the space leading into the trachea (larynx) and allow a food bolus to continue down the esophagus and finally into the stomach and intestines. When swallowing, there is a momentary stop in breathing to ensure that food travels down the correct path of the esophagus. With aspiration pneumonia, the laryngeal reflex gets overwhelmed, or it does not function properly, so food and liquid make their way into the larynx, down the trachea, and into the lungs.

This would be considered a medical emergency. If you believe your dog is experiencing this, contact an emergency veterinary hospital immediately. Commonly, smaller particles are inhaled and may block small airways which leads  to an inflammatory response that produces mucus and inflammatory cells that create a tightening of the muscles of the airways, known as a bronchospasm.  This leads to coughing, wheezing, and overall makes it uncomfortable to fully breathe in and out. Another phase of aspiration pneumonia involves damage from inhaling acidic gastric enzymes. This change in pH easily damages the respiratory surface layer (epithelium) and lung surfactant (a chemical substance that aids in breathing) function. This may cause bronchospasms and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can result in a medical emergency. Lastly, a bacterial pneumonia may develop. The level of infection may overwhelm a dog’s immune system instantly or may occur later in the disease. Symptoms of Aspiration Pneumonia in Dogs Symptoms of aspiration pneumonia in dogs may include: Vomiting, regurgitation, or difficulty swallowing Coughing Exercise intolerance Fever Nasal discharge Difficulty breathing or respiratory distress Breathing at a fast rate, but may not be panting Cyanotic or blue gums and tongue Causes of Aspiration Pneumonia in Dogs Examples of instances that lead to aspiration pneumonia in puppies include: Bottle-feeding puppies that have a normal anatomy but may choke on milk that pours out of the bottle too quickly. Force-feeding a mentally dull animal that may be unable to swallow properly. A puppy with cleft palate where milk enters the nasal cavity and continues down into the lungs. The most common cause of aspiration pneumonia in adult dogs is regurgitation due to a dilated esophagus ( megaesophagus ). Regurgitation is different from vomiting; it is a passive response that expels the contents from the esophagus usually before the food reaches the stomach. It can be delayed for several hours, or it can occur shortly after eating. Often, ingesta (food material) can be seen in a tubular form and appear undigested. Regurgitation may occur as a result of stress or anesthesia especially in brachycephalic breeds such as: Boston Terriers , Pugs , Frenchie, Bullmastiff , Cane Corso , Boxer , English and American Bulldogs, and Dogue de Bordeaux. Vomiting is an active response that requires the contraction of the abdominal muscles to actively propel food and liquid (may also include yellow bile) out of the stomach and small intestines. Other causes of aspiration pneumonia include: Pharyngeal abnormalities (local paralysis, focal myasthenia gravis, and traumatic nerve damage) Esophageal abnormalities Anatomical malformations Generalized neuromuscular disease Forebrain disease Postictal phase (after a seizure) Motor dysfunction Post-operative laryngoplasty Altered consciousness, sedation, anesthesia (during or in recovery) Severe metabolic disorders Force-feeding Improper feeding tube placement Trauma How Veterinarians Diagnose Aspiration Pneumonia in Dogs Dogs with aspiration pneumonia may be in shock and require aggressive care to stabilize them. If your dog does not have any signs of respiratory distress, your veterinarian may order bloodwork to look for an infection. Your vet may also order X-rays to look for a bronchoalveolar pattern in the gravity-dependent lung lobes. If your dog is in respiratory distress, a vet will ensure there is no visible obstruction by performing an oral exam to look in the mouth and the back of the throat. If a large obstruction is suspected, a bronchoscopy can be performed. An arterial blood gas test to measure oxygen may also be a part of the monitoring and evaluation in an emergency facility. To diagnose aspiration pneumonia, your vet will perform a tracheal or a bronchoalveolar wash to collect a sample of cells in the trachea or lungs. There are other medical reasons that your dog could develop aspiration pneumonia. Each medical condition has a unique test: Thyroid test (to diagnose hypothyroidism ) Adrenal function test (to diagnose hypoadrenocorticism, also known as Addison’s Disease , and polyneuropathy ) Antiacetylcholine antibodies test (to diagnose myasthenia gravis) Antinuclear antibodies test (to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus) Fluoroscopy imaging with contrast (to diagnose a swallowing disorder, or dysphagia) Treatment of Aspiration Pneumonia in Dogs In severe cases of aspiration pneumonia, your dog may need to be hospitalized at a 24-hour facility that can provide an oxygen cage, bronchodilators to open airways, IV fluid therapy and antibiotics, and anti-nausea and gastrointestinal motility medications. In mild cases, outpatient therapy may be possible. The prognosis depends on the underlying disease that caused the regurgitation and subsequent aspiration pneumonia. Recovery and Management of Aspiration Pneumonia in Dogs The general timeline for recovery from aspiration pneumonia is at least 10 days after the resolution of symptoms. The key to treating pneumonia is to not stop therapy too soon. Treatment can last between 2 and 8 weeks, depending on the severity and underlying cause of the aspiration pneumonia. Prevention and prognosis of aspiration pneumonia greatly depends on the underlying cause. If the underlying cause is serious, and there is a high likelihood for more infections, then the prognosis is poor. Aspiration Pneumonia in Dogs FAQs Can dogs recover from aspiration pneumonia?

The central nervous system is affected and the dog may have trouble walking, appear weak and uncoordinated, or even collapse. Loss of consciousness and sudden death can also occur. Since nontoxic levels can produce these symptoms, owners should monitor for any digestive problems or change in behavior when giving their dog aspirin for any medical reason.

A blood sample will be taken to assess cell counts and serum chemistries. Usually the dog is anemic and has electrolyte abnormalities. Additional blood may also be taken to assess its clotting ability. Treatment Dogs treated within 12 hours with limited signs of distress can have the concentration of aspirin in the body decreased through a prescribed treatment of decontamination. The sooner this care begins, the better. The veterinarian may also recommend you to induce vomiting at home before coming to the clinic for treatment. By inducing vomiting, or pumping the stomach (gastric lavage), the veterinarian will remove as much aspirin as possible. Activated charcoal may be given after vomiting to absorb the aspirin. Medications that encourage healing or protect the gastrointestinal lining are also generally prescribed. Depending on the dog's status, fluids and other supportive treatments may be necessary. Hospitalization and repeated blood analysis is often necessary until the dog is stable. Living and Management Aspirin has several clinical uses. It can be prescribed as a pain reliever, an anti-inflammatory, an anti-platelet agent, and for lowering body temperature. If aspirin is used for a chronic condition, such as to prevent a blockage of the blood vessel (arterial thromboembolism), it is important to follow the veterinarian’s directions, and reducing or discontinuing the aspirin dosage may be necessary if the dog is susceptible to toxicity.",

This damage prevents proper communication between the brain and body. Symptoms of ataxia can vary widely, depending on what area of the nervous system is affected. Ataxia in dogs requires immediate medical attention so your veterinarian can identify the underlying cause and start appropriate treatment. Types of Ataxia in Dogs There are three types of ataxia in dogs: proprioceptive, cerebellar, and vestibular. While the signs may overlap, there are key differences: Proprioceptive ataxia occurs after damage to the spinal cord or brainstem. Dogs use proprioception to sense where their body parts are in relation to one another and their environment. Dogs have difficulty in placing their feet and walking normally. They may drag their back legs, knuckle over (drag their front or back legs), or appear unsteady when walking. Proprioceptive ataxia can affect the front legs, back legs, or both. Cerebellar ataxia occurs when the brain’s cerebellum is damaged. The cerebellum’s main function is to coordinate movement and balance. A dog with cerebellar ataxia usually makes exaggerated movements when walking or has a wide stance when standing. In some cases, dogs may sway back and forth due to their inability to maintain balance. Vestibular ataxia is caused from damage to the inner ear or brainstem. The vestibular system is responsible for balance and positioning; dogs experience a loss of equilibrium when it is damaged. This usually results from an ear infection or severe inflammation within the ear canal. Dogs with vestibular ataxia usually have a head tilt. They may also start circling or falling to a certain side when trying to stand up or walk.

Circling, falling to one side, and vomiting are common in dogs with vestibular ataxia. Abnormal eye movements, known as nystagmus , and a head tilt may also be present. Causes of Ataxia in Dogs There are numerous causes of ataxia in dogs. Some are mild, while others are severe. These causes include but are not limited to the following: Systemic infections, such as canine distemper virus Intervertebral disc disease , the degeneration of one or more of the discs separating the bones of the spine Infection or inflammation of the brain, spine, or ear Tumors of the brain, spine, or ear Idiopathic vestibular disease , a condition that affects the inner and middle ear Head trauma Hypothyroidism Congenital defects, such as cerebellar hypoplasia or liver shunts Nutritional imbalances Hypoglycemia Medication interactions or overdoses Toxin ingestion, such as rodenticides or ethylene glycol How Veterinarians Diagnose Ataxia in Dogs A veterinarian will first gather a history and perform a complete physical exam. If ataxia is present, various tests can be done to determine the underlying cause. These tests include: Otoscopic exam : The veterinarian will look into the ear canal to visualize the ear drum and identify areas of swelling, inflammation, or infection if vestibular ataxia is suspected. Blood work : A sample of blood is taken to check red and white blood cells, platelets, clotting abilities, and internal organ function. This test can identify signs of inflammation, infection, underlying diseases, and toxin exposure. Complete neurological exam : During this test, the veterinarian will assess the nervous system, including posture, gait, nerves, and reflexes, to identify any abnormalities that warrant further testing. Imaging : These tests provide detailed pictures of the nervous and vestibular systems. They help the veterinarian identify the site of damage that is causing the ataxia. Imaging may include an X-ray, a CT scan, or an MRI. These are non-invasive tests, but dogs may need sedation or anesthesia for them. Cerebral spinal fluid analysis : This is an invasive test performed by a specialist in which a small sample of fluid is collected from the spine to test for infection and inflammation that may be causing the ataxia. Treatment of Ataxia in Dogs Treatment includes identifying and managing the underlying cause of ataxia. Treatment options may include the following: Anti-inflammatories, such as prednisone Antibiotics, including clindamycin Antifungals, such as itraconazole Pain medications, such as gabapentin Exercise restriction Physical therapy Some dogs with ataxia may require hospitalization for monitoring and supportive care. Surgery may be required if ataxia is caused by spinal cord compression or tumor. There are times when ataxia can be resolved with rest and medical care; however, some cases of ataxia are incurable, and the condition can only be managed. Recovery and Management of Ataxia in Dogs Ataxia that is curable will usually resolve once the underlying cause has been identified and appropriately treated. This can range anywhere from weeks to months, and frequent rechecks by the veterinarian will be needed to ensure the dog’s symptoms are improving. Some cases of ataxia, such as those caused from congenital defects, will never be cured. Dogs recovering from ataxia should have a safe, comfortable space at home to rest. Care must be taken to keep the dog away from any stairs or potentially dangerous objects. Recovering dogs may need help with potty breaks and meals. Pet parents should always listen to their veterinarian’s recommendations and give medications as prescribed. Prevention of Ataxia in Dogs Many cases of ataxia in dogs cannot be prevented because they occur due to underlying medical conditions. In these situations, pet parents should ensure their dogs receive regular veterinary checkups, and that they stay up to date on preventative care to identify any health problems early on. Ataxia caused by toxin exposure or medication overdoses can be prevented by ensuring toxic chemicals are out of a dog’s reach, and by giving medications only as prescribed. Ataxia in Dogs FAQs Can a dog recover from ataxia? In certain instances, dogs may recover from ataxia with rest and supportive care. This is when the dog has a treatable condition, such as an ear infection or toxin exposure. However, if there is severe damage to the nervous system, ataxia can progressively worsen and lead to poor quality of life. What medications are linked to ataxia? Ataxia can be a side effect of several medications, including gabapentin, metronidazole, and ivermectin. Anesthetics, sedatives, seizure medications, opioids, diuretics, and aminoglycoside antibiotics also have the potential to cause ataxia in some dogs. These side effects should resolve once the medication is out of the dog’s system. Can ataxia go away on its own without medical intervention? Ataxia will not resolve on its own. All dogs with ataxia should be brought to a veterinarian immediately for evaluation. The veterinarian can determine what type of medical intervention is appropriate, based on your dog’s symptoms and overall condition.

Causes of Atlantoaxial Instability in Dogs AA instability is commonly due to a congenital birth defect, either in how the cervical bones (C1 and C2) fit together, the ligaments that connect them, or in the bones themselves. Additionally, trauma, such as being hit by a car, running into objects, or extreme rough play can cause the condition. AA instability most often occurs in younger smaller-breed dogs such as Chihuahuas , Pekingese , Pomeranians , Toy Poodles , and Yorkshire Terriers , but the condition has also been seen in larger breeds like Rottweilers and Doberman Pinschers . How Veterinarians Diagnose Atlantoaxial Instability in Dogs In addition to a physical exam, where the dog will often exhibit pain in their neck and decreased range of motion, bloodwork and urinalysis screenings can be helpful in eliminating other causes and aid in further examination. A full neurologic exam will be performed to test reflexes and cranial nerves, and X-rays will most likely be recommended. Referral to a veterinary neurologist may also be recommended to perform advanced imaging procedures such as CT, MRI, and even a CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) tap to help determine the extent of spinal cord injury. Treatment of Atlantoaxial Instability in Dogs For some dogs with minor discomfort or instability, conservative management with strict crate rest for multiple weeks, along with pain medications (such as gabapentin , tramadol , or other opioids, NSAIDs, or steroids) and a neck brace may be an option. Surgery is, by far, the best option for dogs suffering from this condition, and even though it can be risky given the close proximity to the brain and spinal cord, it does provide the best chance of survival and long-term quality of life. The goal of the surgery is to minimize, if not eliminate, pain and to stabilize the joint, often through screws and bone cement. Dogs that have pre-existing medical conditions are not good candidates for anesthesia. Without surgery, the prognosis for AAI is guarded, and symptoms can persist and progress to the point where quality of life is affected. Recovery and Management of Atlantoaxial Instability in Dogs For dogs being managed with medications only, it is critical that they be protected from any type of trauma, even minor bumps and scratches, as clinical signs can reoccur and have devastating consequences. Even with the utmost care and consideration, signs can recur and become progressive, as mentioned above. Dogs that have undergone successful surgery can go on to live a functional and normal life, although refraining from high-impact activities or rough play is still advised to prevent further trauma or failure of the surgery. Dogs that have neurologic signs or excessive dysfunction at the time of surgery have a much more guarded prognosis and may still suffer with neurologic problems afterward. The recovery period after surgery is often many weeks, with follow-up visits to the veterinarian for repeat X-rays to ensure proper healing and function. After surgery, dogs should be reintroduced to exercise gradually . Raised food and water bowls are helpful to minimize the amount of neck movement.

While not typically an immediate emergency, untreated autoimmune diseases can have serious consequences that can be fatal. Types of Autoimmune Disease in Dogs Autoimmune diseases can manifest in various ways, affecting different parts of a dog’s body. Some common types include: Pemphigus foliaceus : Targets skin cells, causing cracks, fissures, pustules, scaling, and infection Pemphigus erythematosus : Affects skin on the face, particularly in certain breeds like German Shepherds , Collies , and Shetland Sheepdogs Pemphigus vulgaris : Rare and severe; can lead to skin lesions, including erosions and vesicles, affecting various parts of the body, including the lips, nose, nailbeds, and other skin areas Bullous pemphigoid : Separates the top and middle layers of the skin Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) : Affects multiple systems, creating symptoms including lameness, skin lesions, anemia, kidney failure, and seizures Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE) : A benign form of lupus that affects the skin of only the nose and face Myasthenia gravis : Impairs neuromuscular junctions, leading to muscle weakness that can manifest as difficulty eating or swallowing, regurgitation, and generalized limb weakness that often is worsened with exercise Granulomatous Meningoencephalitis (GME) : Inflammation that typically affects the blood vessels of the brain and spinal cord, causing seizures, blindness, circling, and abnormal gait Masticatory myositis : Targets muscles used for chewing; typically affects large-breed dogs and leads to painful and swollen muscles, a reluctance to eat, difficulty swallowing, and eventual weight loss Glomerulonephritis : Impacts kidney function, and includes symptoms associated with kidney failure, such as an increased thirst and urination , muscle wasting, lack of appetite , and swelling of the limbs and abdomen Polyarthritis : Causes joint inflammation, triggering lameness and arthritis Uveodermatologic syndrome (Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like Syndrome): Targets melanin pigment and frequently results in blindness, affecting breeds such as the Akita , Old English Sheepdog , Golden Retriever , Husky , and Irish Setter Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS): Commonly referred to as “dry eye”; occurs in about 1% of the canine population, and more so in Shih Tzus , Cocker Spaniels , Boston Terriers , and Pekingese Pannus (chronic immune-mediated superficial keratitis) : A progressive, non-curable disease that damages the cornea and leads to blindness Immune-Mediated Thrombocytopenia (ITP) : Affects platelets, the cells responsible for blood clotting, leading to extensive bruising and potentially hemorrhage Immune-Mediated Hemolytic Anemia (IMHA) : Impairs the red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the tissues, resulting in weakness, pale gums, difficulty breathing, and/or collapse While IMHA, ITP, and pemphigus foliaceus occur in dogs more commonly than other autoimmune diseases, overall, autoimmune disease is uncommon in dogs. Symptoms of Autoimmune Disease in Dogs Dogs suffering from an autoimmune disease will experience symptoms associated with the organs or cell functions targeted by the immune system. Some symptoms can occur sporadically, worsening over time, and some can occur suddenly. Though not an exhaustive list, depending on the area under attack by the immune system, dogs commonly will show symptoms including: Anemia (low red blood cell count) Blood in the urine or stool Bruising and pinpoint hemorrhages seen on the gums or skin (petechiae) Collapse Decreased appetite Depigmentation of the skin and nose Difficulty breathing or an increased respiratory rate Difficulty eating Enlarged lymph nodes Erythema (redness) of the skin Fever Hair loss Increased heart rate Kidney failure Lameness Lethargy Mouth ulcers and bad breath Muscle atrophy Pale gums Painful or stiff muscles and joints Scaling, redness, crusting, and skin ulcerations Seizures Sneezing, often with blood (epistaxis) Swelling of the limbs or abdomen Vomiting Causes of Autoimmune Disease in Dogs Autoimmune diseases can affect any breed, but they are more frequently observed in unspayed females. Contributing factors include genetics (with a higher occurrence in purebreds), cancer , or environmental influences like UV light, infections, medications, or other medical therapies. Dogs diagnosed with one autoimmune disease are more likely to develop other immune-mediated diseases. How Veterinarians Diagnose Autoimmune Disease in Dogs Diagnosing autoimmune diseases can be challenging. Such a diagnosis is often made through a process of exclusion, which means that other possible causes are ruled out and the true underlying cause remains unknown. Veterinarians typically use blood work, urine tests, and other screenings to identify potential issues. In some cases, a biopsy or advanced imaging such as a CT scan or MRI may be necessary. While not all tests are 100% confirmatory, when analyzed together with the symptoms, there can be sufficient information to make an immune-mediated diagnosis. Treatment of Autoimmune Disease in Dogs Because autoimmune diseases occur due to an over-reactive and inappropriate immune system, treatment aims at suppressing the immune system. This is often approached using prescription medications called immunosuppressants. Steroids at high doses are the most prescribed drug and the most effective, though they have adverse side effects. To minimize or avoid these side effects, other immunosuppressive drugs may be used in conjunction with steroids. Because certain drug combinations appear to work better for specific conditions and have a variable response in the individual, be sure to partner with your veterinarian for the best therapy options for your dog. Because many dogs suffering from the negative effects of autoimmune disease experience pain or discomfort and poor quality of life, pain medications will often be prescribed. Many dogs with autoimmune disease also have secondary infections, and antibiotics may be needed. Additionally, topical therapies such as ointments, shampoos , or conditioners are often prescribed in conjunction with oral medications as an effective way to target localized lesions and decrease the dose of oral medications. Affected dogs typically don’t require a change of diet or supplements, but some dogs with long-lasting kidney issues or glomerulonephritis can benefit from prescription diets such as Royal Canin Renal .

In the acute hospital setting, dogs may require: Blood transfusions IV fluids A feeding tube Medication to prevent seizures Anticoagulants to help prevent blood clots Anti-nausea and antiemetic medications to prevent vomiting Oxygen therapy Therapeutic abdominocentesis, where fluid is drained from the abdomen Thoracocentesis, where fluid is drained from the body. Recovery and Management of Autoimmune Disease in Dogs Autoimmune diseases vary in prognosis. For example, dogs with DLE typically show improvement within eight to twelve weeks. However, those with myasthenia gravis have about a 33% chance of improving, going into remission, or not surviving. Complications from the disease and the treatment itself can lead to the humane euthanasia of many dogs. While autoimmune diseases are not curable, they can be managed with lifelong medications. It may take months to see significant improvement. Once symptoms are resolved, your veterinarian may recommend tapering drug therapy to the lowest effective dose to manage symptoms while minimizing side effects. Relapses can occur, but tapering drugs benefits your dog in the long run. Regular follow-up and monitoring are vital to prevent relapse and assess drug side effects. Always adhere to your vet’s recommendations and consult them before discontinuing or self-tapering medications. Prevention of Autoimmune Disease in Dogs Unfortunately, most autoimmune diseases cannot be prevented, but a prompt diagnosis followed by immediate treatment can be lifesaving. Be sure to have your dog examined by their vet at the first sign of a problem. Be sure to follow your veterinarian’s recommendations for recheck examinations to minimize relapses. Additionally, make sure that all veterinary providers are aware of your dog’s condition and what medications they are taking. Certain medications and vaccines have the potential to exacerbate the condition or cause recurrence of the disease. Since suppressing the immune system can increase the risk of developing other infections like urinary tract infections, regular screening and monitoring for potential infections are essential for your dog’s long-term health. UV light can also exacerbate certain diseases, so try to limit sun exposure by walking your dog in the early morning or late evening and use a pet-approved sunscreen on the bridge of the nose and non-haired skin when necessary. Autoimmune Disease in Dogs FAQs What is the life expectancy of a dog with autoimmune disease? Life expectancy varies based on disease remission, recurrence, and underlying co-morbidities. Humane euthanasia may be necessary for dogs with extensive clinical signs, multi-organ involvement, poor quality of life, unresponsiveness to treatment, or suffering from treatment side effects. What is the most common autoimmune disease in dogs? Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) is one of the most common autoimmune diseases in dogs. It occurs when the immune system targets the body’s platelets, leading to widespread hemorrhage and bruising. What can trigger autoimmune disease in dogs? Autoimmune diseases commonly occur without a known cause. However, several factors underlie most immune-mediated diseases, including genetics, infection, cancer, drugs, and environmental influences.
